has denied Israeli reports stating that he offered to extend the Gaza Strip.","A bereaved Afghan mother took revenge on the Taliban after watching them kill her son in an ambush. Reza Gul killed 25 Taliban fighters and injured five others in a seven-hour gunbattle in Farah province.\n\nGul, who was joined by her daughter and daughter in-law, engaged the Taliban using AK-47s and grenades, despitenever before having used a weapon.\n\nThe embattled mother told Tolo news, a 24-hour Afghan news broadcaster, she was awakened by shots early Tuesday. After seeing that her son had been killed, Gul and the other two women fought back.\n\n\u201cI couldn't stop myself and picked up a weapon,\u201d Gul told Tolo News. \u201cI went to the check post and began shooting back.\u201d\n\nSeema, her daughter-in-law, added: \u201cThe fighting was intensified when we reached the battlefield along with light and heavy weapons. We were committed to fight until the last bullet.\u201d\n\nGul said that the battlefield was covered in Talib fighters after the deadly exchange ended.\n\nWhile the Taliban have not publicly commented on the incident, the Afghan government labeled it a symbol of a public uprising against the Taliban.\n\nTaliban and other groups have regained large swathes of the country as U.S. and NATO forces slowly pull out troops after 14 years of war. The Taliban have targeted government and foreign infrastructure as the group attempts to claw back power it lost in 2001.\n\nWhile the Taliban have made key gains in rural regions, members continue to employ suicide bomber tactics in well protected towns and cities. Earlier this week, 50 people were killed after a suicide bomber detonated a vest during a volleyball competition in Yahyakahil, Paktika province.\n\nThat particular attack prompted President Ashraf Ghani to order a complete overview of the country\u2019s defense forces and to rethink the ban on nighttime raids, which were outlawed by his predecessor, Hamid Karzai.","CNBC is reporting Tesla has chosen Nevada as the site of its Gigafactory.\n\n\"We look forward to meeting with Gov. (Brian) Sandoval and other legislators in Carson City at 4 p.m. tomorrow to announce a major economic development,\" a Tesla rep told Business Insider.\n\nThe Gigafactory is a critical piece of CEO Elon Musk's plan to make a mass-market Tesla car, and lower the cost of carbon-neutral power. Musk has said he intends to double the world's supply of lithium-ion batteries by 2020 and thus drive the price of the power packs downward.

We have not been in a position to corroborate this report by FARS  News.\n\n*     *     *\n\nIraq\u2019s army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe Iraqi Parliament\u2019s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,\u201d Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.\n\nHe said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.\n\nThe senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.\n\nThe Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.\n\nEarlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL\u2019s control in Al-Baqdadi region,\u201d the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.\n\nHe noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.\n\nAl-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition\u2019s planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.\n\nAl-Zameli underlined that  the coalition is the main cause of ISIL\u2019s survival in Iraq.\n\n\u201cThere are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition\u2019s military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),\u201d he told FNA in January.\n\nHe noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.\n\n\u201cThe US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.\n\nHe noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, \u201cThese documents are given to the investigation committee \u2026 and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.\u201d\n\nAlso in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL\u2019s survival in Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,\u201d Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.\n\nHe said the coalition\u2019s support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, \u201cThe coalition has not targeted ISIL\u2019s main positions in Iraq.\u201d\n\nIn late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.\n\nMP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.\n\nHe added that the US and the international coalition are \u201cnot serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month\u201d.\n\nGharawi added that \u201cthe US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.\u201d\n\nSalahuddin security commission also disclosed that \u201cunknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city\u201d.\n\nAlso in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.\n\n\u201cThe international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,\u201d Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.\n\n\u201cThe ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,\u201d she added.\n\nHababi said that the coalition\u2019s precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.\n\nIn late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.\n\nField sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.\n\nIn October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.\n\n\u201cThe US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group \u2013 while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition\u2019s and the US\u2019 claims,\u201d Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.\n\nThe US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.\n\nThe US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.\n\nVideo footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.\n\nThe Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL\u2019s deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue.","\u201cI once sent Tim an email about the quality of music while on hold with Apple.

Specifically, Apple executives wanted to produce a cutting edge health-monitoring tool, one capable of measuring a user's blood pressure, heart rate, stress level and more, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe publication says the setbacks forced Apple executives into a corner when it came to marketing the device to the general consumer. As it stands, Apple Watch boasts a variety of sensors, including accelerometers, touch inputs and a bespoke optical heart rate sensor, the latter of which connects to the iOS Health app for fitness and wellness tracking. While polished and presented in a slick package, Apple Watch is powered by technology on a par with competing devices running flavors of Android.\n\nAside from catchall smartwatch devices, a number of standalone solutions for off-the-shelf medical style monitoring already exist in the form of products \u2014 usually wrist-worn \u2014 from smaller manufacturers and startups. For example, the W/Me band incorporates a specialized sensor to measure a user's autonomic nervous system for keeping track of stress levels, while the latest products from Fitbit tout all-day heart rate monitoring.\n\nApple started development of its Watch four years ago, with an eye on health and fitness, but the project was quickly dubbed a \"black hole\" for sucking in resources. Advanced technology and component reliability failed to meet Apple's rigorous standards, sources said.\n\nFor example, skin conductivity sensors showed promise in early designs, but later testing showed actual results varied person to person, with everything from hairy arms to strap tightness contributing to unreliable readings. The company also investigated incorporating blood pressure and blood oxygen measurement features, but results were inconsistent.\n\nApple is seemingly investing on health-minded devices and programs, as evidenced by recently discovered job postings, but will take a more mainstream approach for the first generation Watch. Instead of focusing exclusively on health and fitness, the device is being positioned as a niche-filling fashion accessory, iOS compatible smartwatch, iPhone companion and daily communicator, among others.\n\nApple Watch does, however, sport a few Apple-only features, including Apple Pay integration and WatchKit development tools that are expected to foster a rich ecosystem of bite-sized apps later this year.","The picture of a possible \"Crabzilla\" measuring about 50 feet has surfaced after such creature was allegedly spotted at a harbor in the United Kingdom. The oddity has led many to ask: could this be real or simply a hoax?\n\nThe photograph of the monster crab first came out in the website Weird Whitstable, which collects exciting and unusual pictures of sightings reported in the town of Whitstable, Kent.\n\nQuinton Winter, the curator of the website, reveals that a follower sent him the picture of the giant crab lurking at the Kent harbor. The satellite image of the crab shows the creature to be about 50 feet in size, more than four times bigger than the biggest crabs alive on the planet. Winter initially thought the crab-like image was due to some sort of sand formation; however, he now believes that it is an actual crab.\n\nWinter says that he may have also seen the gigantic crab when he went for crabbing with his son in the summer of 2013.\n\n\"At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, 'that's a funny looking bit of driftwood,\" said Winter. \"It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws. Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank.

The Japanese spider crab can weigh up to 12 kilograms (26.45 pounds) and its leg span can reach up to 3.8 meters (about 12 feet).\n\nEven though some people believe that the giant crab image is real, there are some who believe it is a hoax and may be the result of computer image manipulation. The image could be an enlarged picture of an edible crab with the scientific name of Cancer pagurus, which is generally found in the waters surrounding the British Isles. However, this crab species is not as big as 50 feet but measures just about 10 inches and weighs just around six pounds.\n\nCheck out the picture of the giant crab of Weird Whitstable and decide for yourself: is it real or a hoax?","Early Tuesday morning, Dornella Conner was \u201criding around, respecting Mike Brown\u201d with her boyfriend De\u2019Angelas Lee when she was injured with flying shards of glass after police officers fired into her car with specialized \u201cbean bag\u201d bullets, designed to help control rioters and unruly protesters.

There was no monetary compensation that made my client keep quiet, but more so the respect for Mr. Cosby. Well that respect has come to an end.

Rumors have pegged that price to range between $5,000 and $20,000. Not a lot, perhaps, compared to a gold Rolex. But a 20-year-old Rolex will still tell the time. Who knows how functional the first Apple AAPL +0.97% Watch will be in five years?\n\nThere is now a new development in the pricing story. A new Apple patent has surfaced for a \u201cMethod and Apparatus for forming a gold metal matrix composite.\u201d In simple terms, this new \u201cApple gold\u201d is lighter, stronger and more scratch-resistant than ordinary 18 karat gold through alloys of low-density ceramic particles instead of precious metals. It also contains roughly half the amount of pure 24 karat gold as ordinary 18 karat gold (which is 75% gold, 15% silver, and 10% copper). The math is all explained in geeky detail on a blog called All This.\n\nHow much actual gold will be in the Apple Watch Edition? For the models on Apple\u2019s current Edition page, the answer is about half an ounce (current value $640). What Apple isn\u2019t showing on this page is a gold Edition with a solid gold link bracelet. This bracelet only appears in stainless steel on the Apple Watch Collection page. It is not an unreasonable assumption that Apple will roll out a gold link bracelet Edition, which could add another full ounce of gold (total current value $1,920).\n\nApple-Watch-Edition-value-of-gold\n\nStill, with John Gruber of Daring Fireball estimating a price range of $10,000\u2013$20,000 for the Edition, the profit margins start looking a little rich. Marco Arment is calling it at $5,000, but he is not talking about a solid gold bracelet. In the fine jewelry business, it is not uncommon for the retail price to be between five and ten times the cost of the raw materials. (see this analysis from Apple Spotlight on how much Tiffany customers pay for \u201cform.\u201d)\n\n\nApple reported in September that the profit margin for the entry level iPhone 6 was 69%, and slightly higher for the pricier models. That iPhone 6 costs Apple $216 to make, according to a teardown published in Re/code. Let\u2019s assume that the basic Apple Watch will cost Apple no more than that, considering that it\u2019s retail prices is supposed to start at $349. That would have the total cost to Apple for the Apple Watch Edition (without the gold link bracelet) at less than $1,000 and the model with the bracelet just above $2,000. The economics of the \u201cApple gold\u201d could allow pricing with iPhone-level profit margins to be $2,999 and $6,999 respectively. For those expecting price points of $5,000 and $10,000, or $10,000 and $20,000, this \u201creasonable\u201d pricing would be a welcome surprise.\n\nAs surprising as it is that the high-end Edition could contain so little actual gold, this is not at all a bad thing. Not only will this new process make the Apple Watch Edition lighter for delicate wrists and more resiliant, but it also might help the cause of (relatively) affordable luxury that Apple has championed. More significantly, this level of innovation in manufacturing follows through on Apple\u2019s commitment to using fewer resources in its products. And since the mining of gold involves a lot of dangerous and underregulated human labor, it\u2019s a win in an area that Apple has taken a lot of heat about for years. From the investor point of view, if the gold Apple Watch is a hit like the iPhone 6 Plus has been, the money saved on gold will add meaningfully to Apple\u2019s already healthy bottom line.\n\nUpdate: As reader Michal Kvasnica points out, the Apple Watch Edition will literally be worth its weight in gold. My original headline was intended rhetorically, not literally. Apple can claim its new gold metal matrix composite is 18 karat because it will be 75% solid gold by weight. The overall weight per volume is where Apple has achieved the savings. The low-density ceramic particles represent a surprising proportion of the volume of the material but still only contribute 25% to the weight. Since no one will buy an Apple Watch Edition with the intention of melting it down for gold, the real point is that \u201cApple gold\u201d is great from an engineering perspective but bad in terms of intrinsic value. Passing the savings along to the (already overpaying) consumer reinforces Apple\u2019s affordable luxury brand promise. A $10,000 starting price, in my opinion, would be abusing that promise.","No, you do not need to adjust your sets, you are actually looking at a woman with three breasts.\n\nJasmine Tridevil wants to work on TV and in a bid to get there she has spent $20,000 on surgery to get an extra boob.\n\nIt was a bit of an uphill struggle for Jasmine, however, as she says she asked between 50 and 60 doctors but none of them wanted to do it because they would be breaking ethics codes.\n\nIt took two years to save up for the surgery but it has now been finished, topped off with a tattooed nipple.\n\nShe told Real Radio 104.1: My whole dream is to get this show on MTV.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nHer mother and sister are no longer talking to her (Picture: Facebook/Jasmine Tridevil)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m dumping every penny I have into this.

Belgian lawmakers also overwhelmingly approved, voting 114-2 to take part, despite widespread concerns that more terrorism may follow in their homeland as a result.\n\nThe White House said in a statement that it welcomed the countries to the coalition.\n\n'These decisions - along with those by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar to participate in airstrikes against ISIL in Syria - demonstrate the clear commitment of the international community to take action together against these terrorists,' the statement reads.","The group calling itself the Islamic State (also ISIS or ISIL) has released a video purporting to show the execution of American journalist Steven Sotloff, according to the Site Intelligence Group.\n\nSotloff is the second American journalist brutally murdered by ISIS in less than two weeks.

She said the intelligence community would work quickly to determine the video's authenticity.\n\nIn the video released Tuesday by ISIS \u2014 entitled \"A Second Message to America \u2014 Sotloff appears dressed in an orange jumpsuit before he is executed by an ISIS member.\n\nSotloff was kidnapped by militants upon crossing into Syria a little more than a year ago.

It doesn't look like the hands-up gesture by Hong Kong protesters is a callback to the events still unfolding in Ferguson. As reported by Quartz, \"The gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders, who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful intentions to police.\"\n\nWhile the gesture might not have been a deliberate cultural reference like Thai protesters adopting the Hunger Games salute, the unplanned nature of its similarity to the Ferguson gesture makes it all the more powerful: Although the two sites of protest are a world apart from each other and are fighting against very different sociopolitical issues, both movements are dealing with police brutality and demonstrating peaceful intent in an act of nonviolent civil unrest.\n\nAnd the fact that Ferguson protesters are marching in solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters makes it all the more moving:\n\n\n\n\nFerguson and Hong Kong may face different conflicts, but some sentiments truly are universal.","Mittens, an ordinary cat with an incredibly ordinary name, is a hermaphrodite whose owner will be giving it gender assignment surgery [via CBC News].

Basically, in the Argentinian legend, the seventh son of a seventh son was suuuuuper susceptible to becoming a werewolf.\nWhat's funny is this apparently has nothing to do with the Argentinian tradition of the seventh son (or daughter) of a family being eligible to become the President's godchild.

Please.\"\n\nUNION TOWNSHIP, Ohio \u2014 A 17-year-old transgender teen was struck and killed by a passing semi trailer on an Ohio interstate on Sunday, and a previously written suicide note later appeared on the teen\u2019s Tumblr blog through scheduled publishing.\n\nLeelah Alcorn was in the roadway when she was struck, and is believed to have walked 3-4 miles from her parents house in nearby Kings Mill, Ohio.\n\nPolice say she died at 2:20 a.m. Sunday.\n\nThe incident is being investigated by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, but local media have reported the incident as the death of a teen \u201cboy,\u201d using Leelah\u2019s (male) birth name, and have made no mention that she was transgender.\n\nFollowing the incident, this entry appeared on Leelah\u2019s blog describing the pain of being \u201ca girl trapped in a boy\u2019s body\u201d and her Christian parents\u2019 refusal to allow her to transition:\n\nSUICIDE NOTE\n\nIf you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be sad, it\u2019s for the better. The life I would\u2019ve lived isn\u2019t worth living in\u2026 because I\u2019m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy\u2019s body, and I\u2019ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally \u201cboyish\u201d things to try to fit in.\n\nWhen I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn\u2019t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don\u2019t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don\u2019t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won\u2019t do anything but make them hate them self. That\u2019s exactly what it did to me.\n\nMy mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.\n\nWhen I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn\u2019t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.\n\nI formed a sort of a \u201cfuck you\u201d attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that\u2019s obviously not what I wanted.\n\nSo they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t kill myself. I was completely alone for 5 months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent\u2019s disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness.\n\nAt the end of the school year, my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media. I was excited, I finally had my friends back. They were extremely excited to see me and talk to me, but only at first. Eventually they realized they didn\u2019t actually give a shit about me, and I felt even lonelier than I did before. The only friends I thought I had only liked me because they saw me five times a week.\n\nAfter a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I\u2019ve had enough. I\u2019m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I\u2019m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I\u2019m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I\u2019m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I\u2019m never going to find a man who loves me. I\u2019m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There\u2019s no winning. There\u2019s no way out. I\u2019m sad enough already, I don\u2019t need my life to get any worse. People say \u201cit gets better\u201d but that isn\u2019t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.\n\nThat\u2019s the gist of it, that\u2019s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that\u2019s not a good enough reason for you, it\u2019s good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don\u2019t give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren\u2019t treated the way I was, they\u2019re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say \u201cthat\u2019s fucked up\u201d and fix it. Fix society. Please.\n\nGoodbye,\n\n(Leelah) Josh Alcorn\n\nIn a second post, Leelah expressed apologies to her sisters and brother.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: If you or a young person you know is LGBT and thinking about suicide, please call The Trevor Lifeline at 1-866-488-7386, or the Trans Lifeline at 1-877-565-8860.

Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim leveled the charge as he asked the Security Council to investigate whether harvesting and selling the organs of those it executes. The claim followed an unconfirmed report late Tuesday that as many as 45 people captured by the Islamic State in the Anbar Province town of al-Baghdadi had been rounded up and burned alive.\n\n\"We have bodies,\" Alhakim told his international counterparts. \"Come and examine them. It is clear they are missing certain parts.\"\n\nAlhakim, who said a dozen doctors have been executed in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting, briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused the Islamic State group of \"crimes of genocide\" in targeting certain ethnic groups. The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.\n\nMladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that \"it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day.\" He used an acronym for the group.\n\nHe said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that the Islamic State has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law.\n\n\"Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,\" Mladenov said.\n\nThe identities of the victims who were reportedly burned alive Tuesday in al-Baghdadi are not clear, the local police chief told the BBC. ISIS fighters reportedly captured most of the town last week.\n\nCol. Qasim Obeidi, pleading for help from the Iraqi government and international community, said a compound that houses families of security personnel and officials was now being targeted.\n\nThe reports come days after ISIS released a video purportedly showing the beheadings of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians along a beach in Libya, sparking an international outcry, including commendation from Pope Francis, who called the killings \"barbaric.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, ISIS released another video showing a fleet of vehicles flying the black ISIS flag and driving through what is believed to be the streets of Benghazi, Libya. The video shows the vehicles being cheered by men, women and children as they drive by.\n\nOn Friday, a media group linked to ISIS released a four-minute video titled \"Peshmerga Captives in Kirkuk Province,\u201d which purportedly showed Kurdish prisoners -- imprisoned in iron cages -- being driven around on trucks in Iraq, according to the Middle East Media Research Institute.\n\nThe imagery of the prisoner convoy in orange uniforms was similar to the scenes of an execution of a Jordanian pilot. In a video released by ISIS two weeks ago, Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh was shown being burned alive in a cage.\n\nAl-Baghdadi, which is about 50 miles northwest of Ramadi in Anbar province, is located about five miles from Ain al-Asad air base, where 400 U.S. military personnel are training Iraqi soldiers and Sunni tribesmen to take on ISIS. The base was raided last week by a small band of fighters, in what some experts believe may have been a probe in preparation for a full-scale attack.\n\nThe base has been the target of sporadic mortar fire in past weeks, and the jihadist army has been moving forces from its strongholds in Syria to Anbar Province, possibly setting the stage for a major clash with forces on the base that is now the sole bulwark between ISIS and Baghdad.\n\nThere are currently nearly 2,600 U.S. forces in Iraq, including about 450 who are training Iraqi troops at three bases across the country, including al-Asad. Forces from other coalition countries conduct the training at the fourth site, in the northern city of Irbil.\n\nBut even if Islamic State militants close in on the base, taking it would require a massive force, that would present a target for airstrikes, retired Col. Thomas Lynch, a National Defense University fellow, told Fox News.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","The woman claiming to have 3 boobs is A FRAUD ... A FAKE ... and ironically what exposed her lie is a crime someone committed against her.\n\nJasmine Tridevil has been making the rounds, claiming she got plastic surgery to netted her an additional boob.\n\nBut we got a document from the Tampa International Airport Police Dept. describing a baggage theft. According to the doc ... someone stole a bunch of luggage off an American Airlines conveyor belt, including a black nylon roller bag.\n\nCops caught the thieves after IDing them with surveillance video.

Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be here a very short while to know they can do very very little.\"\n\nThe news comes amid reports of an emerging alliance between Isis forces in Syria and Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the Nusra Front.\n\nThe group is the Syrian offshoot of al-Qaeda and has been fighting against the Assad regime in the civil war.\n\nDespite months of clashes between its forces and Isis (also known as Islamic State) militants, the two groups appear to be forming a loose coalition in parts of the country to fight increasing attacks by the US and its allies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAl-Nusra\u2019s official spokesperson, Abu Firas al-Suri, threatened the coalition nations with retaliation on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThese states have committed a horrible act that is going to put them on the list of jihadist targets throughout the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is not a war against al-Nusra, but a war against Islam.\u201d\n\nAl-Nusra and Isis leaders are now holding war planning meetings together, a source told the Guardian, although no formal alliance has been confirmed.\n\nThe reports follow growing defections from other Islamist groups to Isis, which is seen as better organised and equipped to create an \u201cIslamic State\u201d straddling Iraq and Syria.\n\nA loyalty pledge was reportedly made by al-Nusra in June in the town of Al-Bukamal near the Iraqi border, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, and the two groups have fought together against Government forces.\n\nThe report appeared to be confirmed on Twitter by a photograph showing an Egyptian al-Nusra Front commander shaking hands with an Isis leader of Chechen origin.\n\nAlthough both Isis and al-Nusra are rooted in al-Qaeda, the two have been rivals since Isis started its involvement in Syria\u2019s civil war in spring last year and have engaged in bloody battles killing more than 3,000 militants from both sides.\n\nA merger had been declared by Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2013, when Isis was known as al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), but the alliance was rejected by al-Nusra and overruled by al-Qaeda leader al-Zawahiri.\n\nBut the international response to Isis\u2019 bloody rampage through Iraq and Syria, and the beheadings of British and American hostages, is pushing the groups towards an alliance.\n\nAn al-Nusra source told Reuters: \u201cThere are hardline voices inside Nusra who are pushing for reconciliation with Islamic State.\u201d\n\nA formal alliance is believed to only be possible on the orders of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.\n\nA deal between the militant groups would strengthen the Islamist force in Syria as air strikes cripple Isis funding sources, equipment stores and slow its advances.\n\nThe US has not said al-Nusra is being targeted but its planes have attacked a new group called Khorasan, which some analysts suspect is part of al-Nusra.\n\nThe two groups have been known to co-operate and Khorasan is believed to be made up of veteran al-Qaeda fighters with battlefield experience mostly in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nBritain, the US and the United Nations are among those who have classed al-Nusra as a terrorist group, citing its use of suicide bombing, terrorist attacks and attempts to impose Islamic law.\n\nA small number of anti-Government groups, including some members for the secular Free Syrian Army, opposed the label after al-Nusra gained respect fighting the Assad regime.","In a day packed with major Apple announcements, the company tackled smartphones, wearables, and payments. But there is one more sector that may be about to get the Apple treatment: Social.\n\nAccording to a single well-placed source inside Apple\u2019s engineering team, the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morin\u2019s Path social network. To quote our source, who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet, \u201cIt\u2019s almost done, if not signed already, but it\u2019s essentially a done deal.\u201d\n\nIf true, it would be major news for the heretofore struggling social platform that has been known more for its design and user interface innovations than for its ability to drive adoption among consumers \u2013 particularly in non-Asian markets. Apple hasn\u2019t fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color.\n\nAccording to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apple\u2019s newly refreshed Messages app. That doesn\u2019t mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebook\u2019s $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google.\n\nFacebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user. With Path having somewhere in the vicinity of 25 million users at the beginning of this year, and far weaker growth and engagement than any of the above platforms, it would be lucky to command anywhere near Instagram/Whatsapp sums. According to App Annie, Path ranks just 177th among iOS Social Networking apps in the US and not among the top 1000 overall iOS apps. When Path raised its most recent round in January of this year, the company reportedly commanded a sub-$400 million valuation, well below the $500 million-plus levels reportedly sought by management. Given the trajectory it was on, exiting at that level would likely be considered a win among most Path insiders. Hell, for many Valley observers, that would be the win of the century for Path investors, many of which have all but left the company for dead.\n\nApple\u2019s re-entry into social would also be a notable development. With Facebook (including Instagram and Whatsapp), Twitter, and Snapchat each looking stronger than ever in their respective social verticals, it\u2019s unclear just where an Apple-driven social product would fit in among consumers daily habits. Google seems to have reached a similar conclusion, all but abandoning its strategy of pushing Google+ as a standalone social platform, and instead choosing to let the platform fade into the background of its other consumers platforms like Gmail and YouTube. Apple\u2019s one stronghold has been in messaging via iMessage, which recently got a facelift. And Path has recently leaned more in this direction with its launch of an ephemeral messaging product, abandoning its long-held love of more lasting, intimate communications. It\u2019s certainly conceivable that Path could be integrated into Apple\u2019s messaging platform, but it\u2019s unclear, beyond the design prowess, how this acquisition helps Apple, at any price.\n\nAdding additional fuel to this fire, Dave Morin was spotted sitting in the front row for today\u2019s Apple keynote event, a high profile position reserved for Dr. Dre and other key Apple insiders.\n\nDid not forget about Dre. pic.twitter.com/fWNDpFhfYr \u2014 Dave Morin (@davemorin) September 9, 2014\n\nApple has been known to be a fan of Morin\u2019s, as well as the Path design aesthetic and broader design team. Take for example the company\u2019s decision to feature the Path app early on in numerous keynotes and advertising campaigns. In that sense, it wouldn\u2019t be that surprising if such a deal were to be consummated. Jason Calacanis made a similar observation in his evening email newsletter today, noting Morin\u2019s seating at today\u2019s event and Apple\u2019s long-standing frustrations around social. Others have been asking whether such an acquisition makes sense for years.\n\nTo be clear, even if our source is correct, these transactions are never a sure thing until ink has been put to paper and (at least in the case of a public company like Apple) a public announcement has been made. But the tea leaves seem to be aligning on this deal. It\u2019s certainly an unexpected outcome, but it would sound even more crazy if Apple didn\u2019t have north of $150 billion in cash burning a hole in its pocket and a love for all things aesthetic. And with Morin\u2019s vaunted reputation for design, and Apple\u2019s social struggles I can\u2019t think of a better home for the once-hyped app. Don\u2019t be surprised to see Apple swoop in to rescue Path from social also-ran status.\n\nPando has reached out to Morin for confirmation (or otherwise) of the claim. We will update this post as soon as I hear back.","Islamic State terrorists couldn\u2019t strike ransom deals with the United States to trade hostages for money \u2014 so their newest revenue drive has them attempting to sell the body of James Foley, one of their beheaded victims.\n\nSeveral sources for the Islamic State told BuzzFeed News that middlemen have been trying to strike a sale, with the asking price for Foley\u2019s remains at $1 million.\n\nAds by Adblade\n\n\nHow penny stocks make millionaires every day...\n\nNew Site Exposes Anyone!

At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.\"\n\nHowever, after Alex had changed his mind about the party, Ms Nash realised he had no way of contacting the birthday boy's mother.\n\n\"So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do - he chose to be with his grandparents,\" he said.\n\n\"By this time we did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy's mother] know.\"\n\nAlex returned to Torpoint Nursery and Infant School on January 6, but just over a week later, the family were stunned to receive the bill.\n\nMr Nash continued: \"My partner looked out for [the friend's mother] to apologise for Alex not showing up to the party, but didn't see her.\n\n\"But on January 15 she looked in Alex's school bag and found a brown envelope. It was an invoice for 15.95 for a child's party no show fee.\n\n\"I asked Alex's class teacher if [the child's mother] had given anything to her.

Waking up in the middle of brain surgery sounds like a painful experience, but when this happened to 19-year-old Iga Jasica she didn\u2019t feel a thing. The teen just asked the surgeons how the operation was going when she suddenly woke up on the table, according to Fox News on Jan. 3.\n\nIt is a mystery as to why the girl woke up during the delicate procedure while on the operating table in Poland. The doctors were shocked to hear her talk to them while they had her brain exposed mid-surgery. The hospital is looking into the possibility that the anesthesia was improperly administered.\n\nExperts say that the procedure itself could have caused the teen to regain consciousness even with enough anesthesia on board to knock her out. Jasica chatted with the doctors a bit when she woke up during the surgery and apparently she had a lot to say. She brought up the subject of cats to the physicians who were literally working on her exposed brain, according to Sports Act today.\n\nEven though the teen woke up enough to carry on a conversation, she was never in any pain or danger when this happened say doctors. Jasica was having a cancerous growth removed from her brain during this procedure, reports Headlines &amp; Global News today. The doctors were about half-way through the operation when the teen woke up.\n\nThe teen reports that she was happy to have gone through the operation because she is feeling good today.

Did she do it, as we and others reported, because of the legend of the werewolf? No.\n\nThe Guardian reports that a tradition that began during mass Russian immigration to Argentina in the early 20th century became conflated with a local legend involving seventh sons and werewolves.\n\n\"The local myth of the [lobison] is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son [or seventh daughter] born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,\" Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda told the newspaper.\n\nThe emigres from Russia who asked the Argentine president in 1907 to become the godfather to their seventh son were carrying on a custom from czarist Russia. The practice became law in 1974.\n\nOur original post is below:\n\nSilver bullets are believed to be among the few effective weapons against werewolves. In Argentina, add presidential protection to that short list.\n\nPresident Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, in keeping with a long-standing tradition, has embraced a 21-year-old Jewish man as her godson to prevent him from assuming a lycanthropic form.\n\nThe root of the story is the mythology of the Guarani people that says the seventh son in a family of only male children will turn into el lobison \u2014 a werewolf. This legend prompted some people to abandon \u2014 or kill \u2014 their seventh-born sons. So Argentina passed a law in the 1920s that gave the seventh son presidential protection along with a gold medal and a scholarship until his 21st birthday.\n\nAt first, that law covered only Catholic families. But in 2009, a presidential decree broadened the law to cover children of other faiths, too.\n\nKirchner's godson is Yair Tawil, the seventh son of a rabbi, and he's the first Jewish godson of an Argentine president.\n\nThe Jewish Telegraphic Agency reports:\n\nFernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office in Buenos Aires. They lit Hanukkah candles on a menorah the family presented her. Kirchner publicized the event on Twitter, calling the meeting \"magical\" and the Tawil family \"marvelous.\"","(CNN) \u2014The cardiac arrest leading to Joan Rivers' death happened as the comedian's personal doctor began performing a biopsy on her vocal cords, a source close to the death investigation told CNN.\n\nJOAN RIVERS THROUGH THE YEARS\nJoan Rivers blurb\nJoan Rivers has passed away at the age of 81.

The city's transport department said roads in those areas were closed.\n\nMore than 200 bus routes have been canceled or diverted in a city dependent on public transport. Subway exits have also been closed or blocked near protest area.

The searing fumes sent demonstrators fleeing, though many came right back to continue their protest. The government said 26 people were taken to hospitals.\n\nTo ward off tear gas, demonstrators improvised with homemade defenses such as plastic wrap, which they used to cover their face and arms, as well as umbrellas, goggles and surgical masks.\n\nThe protests began with a class boycott last week by students urging Beijing to grant genuine democratic reforms to this former British colony.\n\n'This is a long fight,' business and law student Edward Yau, 19, said overnight. 'The government has to understand that we have the ability to undo it if they continue to treat us like we are terrorists.'\n\nU.S.-led mission attacks Islamic militant base near Kobani,...\n\nGerman Shepherd doesn't want to get out of the water\n\nSeal the deal!

It also promised the city's leader would eventually be chosen through 'universal suffrage.'\n\nHong Kong's residents have long felt their city stood apart from mainland China thanks to those civil liberties and separate legal and financial systems.\n\nBeijing's insistence on using a committee to screen candidates on the basis of their patriotism to China - similar to the one that currently hand-picks Hong Kong's leaders - has stoked fears among pro-democracy groups that Hong Kong will never get genuine democracy.\n\nUniversity students began their class boycotts over a week ago and say they will continue them until officials meet their demands for reforming the local legislature and withdrawing the proposal to screen election candidates.\n\nStudents and activists had been camped out since late Friday on streets outside the government complex.

He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,\" Diane Foley said. \"As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own.\"\n\nShe added that the family was told many times that raising ransom \"was illegal (and) we might be prosecuted.\"\n\n\"We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,\" Foley's mother told CNN. \"And he wasn't, was he?\"\n\nIn fact, video posted online on August 19 showed James Foley kneeling next to a man dressed in black, with Foley reading a presumably scripted message that his \"real killer\" is America, then being summarily executed.\n\nISIS -- the Islamist extremist group that's taken over large swaths of Syria and Iraq in its quest to create a far-reaching caliphate under its strict version of Sharia law -- took credit for Foley's beheading, saying it was in response to U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and threatening more killings.\n\n'Our government needs to be ... willing to negotiate'\n\nMore than three weeks later, U.S. President Barack Obama named Foley as he outlined his strategy for fighting ISIS and described the terrorist group's brutality.\n\n\"They enslave, rape, and force women into marriage. They threatened a religious minority with genocide. In acts of barbarism, they took the lives of two American journalists -- Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff,\" Obama said in a televised address Wednesday night.\n\nAs she watched the speech, Diane Foley said one thing was going through her mind.\n\n\"This whole strategy to eliminate ISIS and the terror threat is important, obviously, so perhaps part of the strategic way of doing that is to bomb them, and to engage in force. But that only caused Jim's death,\" she said. \"I guess all I'm trying to say is that our government needs to be shrewder, smarter, willing to negotiate with these people who hate us, so that we can find better ways to rid ourselves of terror.\"\n\nVideo shows ISIS beheading James Foley\n\n'He was compelled to bear witness'\n\nAfter her son's death, Diane Foley wrote on the Free James Foley Facebook page that \"we have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.\"\n\nSometimes, she said Thursday, it was tough for his family to deal with his decisions to report in dangerous parts of the world.\n\n\"At times, even his siblings were angered that he would return after his captivity in Libya. I mean, it was hard as a family to understand, because Jim was so loved ... and we were selfish. We wanted him with us. We wanted him safe,\" she said. \"But Jim was not. Jim was selfless, and he had the courage and the compassion. ... He was compelled to bear witness.\"\n\nTo this end, his family launched a foundation -- the James W. Foley Legacy Fund -- aimed at helping families of American hostages, supporting U.S. journalists in war zones and helping urban youth in educational endeavors.\n\nThe organization is one way the Foley family is trying to honor James' past and do something positive in the future. But none of it takes away Diane Foley's disappointment that more wasn't done -- especially by the U.S. government -- to secure his release, somehow, since his November 22, 2012, disappearance in northwest Syria. At the time he was working for U.S.-based online news outlet GlobalPost.\n\n\"Jim would have been saddened\" by the U.S. government's efforts in the years after his abduction, his mother told CNN. \"Jim believed, till the end, that his country would come to (his) aid.\"\n\nA failed rescue operation\n\nUpon hearing these comments, U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice -- after praising the Foley family for doing \"an amazing job ... to try to bring Jim home safely\" -- said she \"and others in the U.S. government worked very hard with Diane Foley and her family to try to be supportive, to try to provide what information we could.\"\n\nRice also pointed out \"hundreds of American personnel\" were involved in a \"very daring and very well-executed rescue operation\" to free Foley and other captives, after getting what they hoped was \"actionable intelligence\" about the location of the hostages. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby has said elite U.S. commandos undertook this mission this summer inside Syria.\n\nOfficial: U.S. commandos tried, failed to rescue hostages\n\n\"Unfortunately, they were no longer there,\" Rice, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN. \"But I think that effort ... underscores the importance that we attach to doing everything that we possibly can to bring Americans in captivity back home.\"\n\nDiane Foley, though, said the rescue operation came \"very late.\"\n\n\"Their location was known for more than a year,\" she said.\n\nDuring her son's time in captivity, she said, it often seemed the family knew more about his whereabouts than the authorities.\n\n\"I did all I could,\" she said. \"I was unable to do enough.\"\n\nLessons for the future\n\nNow, Diane Foley says she thinks Washington should change its approach to cases like that of her son and Steven Sotloff, another American journalist beheaded by ISIS weeks after James Foley.\n\n\"I pray that our government will be willing to learn from the mistakes that were made,\" she told CNN, \"and to acknowledge that there are better ways for American citizens to be treated.\"\n\nThere should be international dialogue about how to handle hostages of terrorist groups, she said.\n\n\"The risk is becoming higher and higher,\" she said, \"and I really feel that our country let Jim down.\"\n\nObama escalates campaign against ISIS\n\nWatch Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 weeknights 8pm ET.

He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,' Foley said. 'As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own.'\n\nStill grieving, Diane Foley also said US officials told her they would not exchange prisoners or carry out any military action to try and rescue her son.\n\nAt times withering in her assessment of the Obama administration's co-ordination with her family, Mrs. Foley poured scorn on the Pentagon's claim they tried to rescue Foley on July 4, only to raid the wrong base.\n\nSpeaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper, Foley said her family knew where James Foley was being held on two separate occasions in Syria, and that each time he was there for months following his capture on Thanksgiving, 2012.\n\nOn August 19, ISIS released a gruesome video online which showed the beheading of Foley by a masked ISIS militant, who told the camera in a British accent, that his 'real killer' was the United States.\n\nExactly two weeks later, another American journalist, Stephen Sotloff, was beheaded, apparently by the same man, who tells the camera, 'I'm back Obama'.\n\nDuring the efforts to get James home, Mrs. Foley said she met good people, people who wanted to help, but was adamant that she didn't want to single anyone out and lay 'blame'.\n\nMrs. Foley said it was important to remember that ISIS is the enemy and not the United States.\n\nHowever, ultimately, she 'didn't feel that Jim was a priority.'\n\n'We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,' said Foley's mother to CNN.

The smaller phones would supposedly be designed for easy use with just one hand and are said to be ready for sale in the second half of 2015.\nThe news has to be taken with a grain of salt, according to observers. The iPhone 6, which was the company's first major step into the bigger screen size market, has been a huge success and revived Apple for many fans. Insiders say it is highly unlikely that it will backtrack on that trend for a smaller screen.\n\nStill, others say that the rumor may not be as far-fetched as one would imagine. Last year's iPhone 5c was a flop and is on its way out, with the iPhone 5 not too far behind. In an effort to still retain some of the budget market, Apple may be truly looking into re-releasing smaller screens.\n\nThe rumor purports that Apple will be producing the 4-inch displays in response to customer surveys vying for a return to smaller phones.\n\nThose who believe the release of small screen phones are possible are also speculating that Apple would be releasing a cheaper iPhone 6c, iPhone 6 mini, or perhaps even a redesign of the iPhone 5c.\n\nIn the meantime, it is expected that Apple will launch a new line of phones in conjunction with the much-anticipated Apple Watch in the early months of 2015. No word yet if the company will be adding an iPhone 6s or perhaps an iPhone 7 to their phone lineup, or if these rumored 4-inch display phones will even be launched.","Now, that is an awkward dinner conversation\n\nA filmmaker in Peru seems to have come up with an ingenious solution to men sexually harassing women in the street \u2014 trick serial offenders into catcalling their own mothers.\n\nTwo moms are shown agreeing to be secretly filmed as they donned flattering disguises and strolled past their unwitting sons.

Most appear to be civilians, although three of them are wearing military-style camouflage uniforms. One woman stands in front of the rest, her rifle aimed forward at waist level. The muzzle appears to have been taped over, possibly to keep dust out of the barrel.\n\nOn Twitter, Facebook and the Web, the women have been hailed as heroes in the fight against Boko Haram militants in northern Nigeria. \u201cNigerian women who repulsed a Boko Haram attack, kudos to these gutsy bravehearts,\u201d read a typical tweet of the image this week.\n\nThe photograph has been circulating for some time. We found posts dating to 2013, but the image appears to have gone viral in April 2014, around the time that more than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants in Chibok. It has gained renewed currency since this month\u2019s Baga massacre and the battle for the city of Maiduguri.\n\nBoko Haram attack repelled by \u2018armed women\u2019\n\nMany of the more recent tweets link to a fringe news website, Countercurrentnews.com, and a post dated 27 May 2014. The photo is prominently displayed. \u201cAnother Boko Haram attack repelled by armed women,\u201d reads the headline.\n\n\u201cSeveral Nigerian media outlets have been reporting on local women in the villages of Attagara and Kawuri in Borno State who recently disarmed nearly a dozen Boko Haram terrorists,\u201d the article continues.\n\n\u201cThe notorious pseudo-Islamic terror groups tried to attack the Attagara and Kawuri communities over the weekend but the insurgents were instantly repelled by a group of armed women.\u201d\n\n\u2018Get \u2018em ladies\u2019\n\nScreen Shot 2015-01-30 at 9.40.33 AMA pro-gun Facebook page in the United States that calls itself \u201cHypocrisy and Stupidity of Gun Control Advocates\u201d has also appropriated the photo, suggesting that it shows a group of Nigerian teachers.\n\nIt posted the image on 20 January 2015, along with this caption: \u201cWhen Boko Haram showed up to kill and rape us and our students we didn\u2019t hide or throw spaghetti-os\u2026We shot them in the face because we don\u2019t \u2018demand\u2019 action \u2013 we take action.\u201d\n\nThe picture was shared more than 400 times and by 30 January 2015, just over 1,200 Facebook users had \u201cliked\u201d it. \u201cYou get \u2019em ladies,\u201d wrote one. \u201cI find their lack of belt fed weapons and RPGs troubling,\u201d said another. \u201cFace shooting is definitely the way to go,\u201d added a third.\n\nSolving a mystery\n\nWe were intrigued. Where was the photograph taken? What had happened? Who were the women? Were they teachers? Villagers? Vigilantes? We decided to do a little cyber-sleuthing.\n\nThe first clue was a green, yellow and red football shirt worn by a woman in the back row. The second was a bright blue dress worn by another woman with white patches bearing a symbol in similar shades of green, yellow and red. Could they be colours of a national flag?\n\nThe Nigerian flag is green and white. The flag of neighbouring Benin is green, yellow and red but not all the bands run parallel. The colours also appear in Mali\u2019s flag. Usually they run vertically, not horizontally, as they do in the football shirt. But a Google search for images of \u201cMali football jersey\u201d produced photos of football shirts strikingly similar to that worn by the woman in the back row.\n\nVerifying images\n\nTwo invaluable tools that we regularly use at Africa Check to establish the veracity of photos circulating online are Google\u2019s image search function and the \u201creverse image search\u201d engine, Tineye-com. (For more tips, check out our guide to spotting online fakes and hoaxes.)\n\nWe uploaded the image to Google. The results weren\u2019t encouraging. There were dozens of links to web pages, Facebook posts and tweets all claiming that the photograph showed armed Nigerian women who had fought off Boko Haram. None offered any details of where the picture had been taken and who had taken it.\n\nIn fact, the image had been so widely published in relation to Boko Haram that Google\u2019s suggested search term after we uploaded it was \u201cboko haram women\u201d.\n\nWe changed the search term to \u201cMali\u201d and hit enter.\n\nThe claim is a hoax\n\nAs it turns out, our hunch was correct. The photo was first published on 23 November, 2012 in The Times of London. It had been taken by a Times photographer, Jack Hill, in the town of Sevare in Mali and accompanied an article by one of the newspaper\u2019s correspondents, Jerome Starkey, about \u201cwomen bent on revenge against Tuareg rebels in Mali\u201d.\n\nThe women \u2013 all members of the Ganda Koy militia, a pro-government paramilitary force \u2013 had vowed to avenge relatives they said had been killed or raped by Tuareg rebels belonging to the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA). Few, if any of the women, had seen combat when the photograph was taken.\n\nThe story of the Nigerian teachers standing up to Boko Haram militants is nothing more than a hoax.\n\nA wrap of online fakes and hoaxes\n\nThere are numerous images circulating online that purport to show Boko Haram atrocities. Some are genuine. Many are not.\n\nEarlier this month, the militant group attacked the towns of Doro Gowon and Baga in northern Nigeria. Eyewitnesses say hundreds were killed and satellite images obtained by human rights groups show that dozens of shops, houses and buildings were torched.\n\nIn the weeks since the attack a series of graphic images have spread online as evidence of what has become known as the \u201cBaga massacre\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s our wrap of the images we have fact-checked so far.\n\n(WARNING: Some of the photographs in the links below are extremely graphic.)\n\nOne of the most disturbing photographs shows dozens of charred corpse lying in rows. However the image actually shows the aftermath of a fuel tanker explosion in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2010.\n\nAnother ghastly image shows the burnt corpses of a mother and child. We have been unable to verify its exact origin, but searches on Google and the reverse image search engine, Tineye.com, show that the image has been circulating since at least 2010 and is therefore not from the recent Baga attacks. Given the condition of the bodies, they may have been victims of the fuel tanker explosion, but we cannot say for certain.\n\nYet another photograph attributed to the Baga massacre shows a crowd clustered around a mass grave. However, that image dates from a massacre near the Nigerian city of Jos in March 2010.\n\nThen there is the image of a number of grotesquely mutilated corpses strewn across a road next to a bus. It was actually taken in 2010. According to a BBC report at the time, a series of photographs emerged after armed robbers attacked a bus on the Lagos-Benin highway. The victims had reportedly been made to lie down in the road and then the bus driver was ordered to run them over.\n\nEven a Reuters photograph of a group of men lying face down outside a police station after their arrest in the city of Bauchi in northeastern Nigeria on 25 July 2009 has been passed off as evidence of the Baga massacres and has spread widely on the web and Twitter.\n\nAnother image that has gone viral on Twitter shows a pile of bloodied bodies lying in street. It is also not from Baga but was taken in July 2009 by an Associated Press photographer outside a police station in the town of Maiduguri after clashes between Nigerian troops and Islamist militants left hundreds dead.\n\nNot all the hoaxes involve images of atrocities. A photograph of two men in camouflage uniform being chased by a zebra has been widely distributed as evidence of the Nigerian army\u2019s cowardice. Trouble is, there are no zebras in the wild in Nigeria. It turns out that the photograph was actually taken by a Reuters photographer in Kenya on 30 July 2007. Two Kenya Wildlife Service rangers, working to help move 2,000 animals to the Meru National Park, had to make a run for it when a recalcitrant zebra charged them.","A top police officer involved in the Charlie Hebdo investigation killed himself within hours of the massacre.\n\nHelric Fredou, 45, shot himself with his police-issued gun after meeting relatives of one of the 12 victims of the terror attack at the magazine's Paris office, according to reports.\n\nMr Fredou was Deputy Director of the Regional Service Judicial Police in Limoges, south of the French capital, and is believed to have been one of the leading figures in the investigation into the attack.\n\n\nFrench media reported that the single police officer, who had no children, had complained of being \"depressed\u201d and overworked before the massacre.\n\nHis body is thought to have been discovered in his office at Limoges by a colleague at around 1am on Thursday morning.\n\n\nTribute: flowers, candles and a placard which reads \"I am Charlie\" are displayed during a gathering at the Place de la Republique in Paris (Picture: Reuters)\nThe Commissioners' Union of the National Police confirmed Mr Fredou's death.\n\nIt said in a statement: \"It is with great sadness that we were informed this morning of the death of our colleague Helric Fredou , assigned as Deputy Director of the Regional Service Judicial Police in Limoges.\n\n\"On this particular day of national mourning , police commissioners are hit hard by the tragic death of one of their own .\n\n\nThe two gunmen open fire in the street during the attack\n\"The Union of Commissioners of the National Police would like to present its most sincere condolences to the relatives of Helric.\"\n\nMr Fredou had been a police officer since 1997 and was appointed Deputy Director in 2012.\n\nHis death came within hours of brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi shooting 12 people dead in Paris.","An angry aunt is facing jail time in China, after she was interrupted on the toilet by her three-year-old nephew, and proceeded to slice off his penis in anger.\n\nXue Paan, 37, reportedly attacked her nephew, Qiang Qiang in a rage, while she babysat him as his mother, her sister, went to visit neighbors nearby.\n\nAccording to reports, Paan was sitting on the toilet sending text messages to her boyfriend when the bored toddler burst into the bathroom and asked if he could play games on her smart phone.\n\nThe question from the youngster apparently sent Paan into such a rage that she went to the kitchen, grabbed a blunt knife and severed the screaming child\u2019s penis completely.\n\nHaving attacked her helpless nephew, Paan reportedly fled the scene as Qiang\u2019s mother heard her son\u2019s screams and rushed to the apartment, \u201cI had popped out to see a neighbour and was only gone 30 minutes when I heard Qiang Qiang scream.\u201d\n\nThe child had apparently fainted from the pain and shock of the ordeal, and was laying a pool of his own blood when his mother arrived, a knife was next to his severed penis.\n\nQiang\u2019s mother said, \u201cI ran back to the house and couldn\u2019t believe what I saw.\u201d\n\nQiang Qiang was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to reattach his penis, he and was then sent to a specialist clinic in the capital Beijing.\n\nA spokesperson for the hospital told reporters.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the knife was quite blunt and the cut wasn\u2019t clean so although we reattached the boy\u2019s penis, it wasn\u2019t ideal and he had to have further treatment.

I took it and went straight to his regular drinking place and when I got there I became angrier. I didn't hesitate to pour the acid on him,\" she said.\n\nKhoza, who had no problem with his name being published, but asked not to be photographed, said he had been dating the girl since December.\n\n\"Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle, but I didn't realise that she was carrying acid.

Burton reportedly hadn\u2019t planned to marry Manson for love, but for profit. She and a friend by the name of Craig Hammond wanted to rake in money by putting Manson\u2019s corpse in a glass crypt. As Simone says, it was a \u201cCalifornia version of Lenin\u2019s Tomb\u201d and \u201cwould draw huge crowds and make big money.\u201d\n\nThe 80-year-old has no interest in having his body displayed in a glass coffin.

Therefore, he feels it\u2019s a stupid idea to begin with.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s marriage license expired on Thursday, as Inquisitr revealed.

When the pair asked Manson to sign a document that would allow them to take his body after he dies.\n\nWhat Burton and Hammond may not have realized, is that Manson was playing them. Simone says Manson didn\u2019t give them a yes or no on signing the document.

He added that no teams were looking to move, including the struggling Florida Panthers \u2014 even if their new owner has concerns about the club's arena lease.\n\n\"Nobody's moving,\" said Bettman. \"And speculation to the contrary not only is wrong, it's unfair to the team and their fans who are being speculated about.\n\n\"Our franchises have never been healthier. Our league, in terms of its economic footing, has never been healthier.\"\n\nHe made the remarks at an event put on by a media company, Quebecor, that hopes to bring NHL hockey back to Quebec City.\n\nNHL coffers were fattened by a 12-year deal worth $5.2 billion with Rogers, which will begin broadcasting games this season on Sportsnet. Quebecor reportedly will pay Rogers a total of $1.5 billion over 12 years for the French-language portion of the broadcast rights, with games aired mainly on TVA Sports.\n\nQuebecor bought naming rights on a $400 million arena due to be completed by fall 2015 in Quebec City, which hopes to land an NHL club.\n\nBettman attended TVA Sports' hockey launch at a suburban restaurant along with former prime minister Brian Mulroney, who is chairman of Quebecor, Montreal Canadiens owner Geoff Molson, Quebec Major Junior Hockey League president Gilles Courteau and other league and company officials.\n\nHowever, Bettman had no encouraging words for those looking to revive the Quebec Nordiques, who left in 1994 to become the Colorado Avalanche.\n\n\"We don't want to build up anybody's expectations,\" he said. \"We're not in a position to expand.\n\n\"We're certainly not in position to expand into the East. We've been very candid and up front that if in fact we go through an expansion process, the world will know about it. But we're not looking to relocate any franchises, and we're not looking to expand. We've been very clear about that since Day One when we were told about the building of the new arena.\"\n\nStill, rumours that the league is at least considering adding teams have been circulating. A report from Vancouver last week said a team in Las Vegas was a \"done deal.\"\n\nBettman said there's plenty of interest from people wanting NHL expansion teams but added the league hasn't even begun to research the issue.\n\nIn June, Bettman said that if there were enough expansion candidates the league's board of governors \"may well invoke a formal expansion process and we will look at everything.\"\n\nMulroney had no comment on Quebec City's expansion prospects.\n\nDuring the news conference, the former Conservative prime minister joked that he was a \"right winger\" when he played as a boy in Baie-Comeau, Que., and told a story about how his father discouraged him from trying to become a pro player because there was no money in hockey.\n\n\"If he was alive today, I'd take him by the hand and say: 'Let me introduce you to P.K. Subban,'\" he said.\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens defenceman signed a $72 million, eight-year contract on Aug. 2.\n\nBettman said the league is close to naming a successor to Brendan Shanahan as disciplinarian and head of player safety. Shanahan stepped down in April and was replaced on an interim basis by Stephane Quintal.\n\n\"We're getting to the short strokes of that process,\" said Bettman. \"We've interviewed a lot of candidates, including somebody who's been doing it on an interim basis, and we will be making a decision shortly.\n\n\"We wanted to finish the process. By the start of the season, we'll have an announcement.\"","Are you a fan of Justin Bieber\u2019s music?

According to the Wall Street Journal, the deal would value Mojang at more than $2 billion and could be signed as soon as this week.\n\nMicrosoft and Mojang declined to comment to the Journal.

The Journal argues that owning Minecraft could \"invigorate\" Microsoft's Xbox business, though the game has long been available on that platform.\n\nMojang has been seen as an unlikely target for acquisition because its small team of about 40 people makes a highly profitable game in Minecraft and whose leader has expressed a desire to invest those profits in unusual new games.

You sweat more if you're nervous, and that makes your skin more conductive.\n\nThe Watch also included an electrocardiogram feature that measures a user's heart rate (that's more in-depth than simply measuring a pulse).

The legend stems from indigenous folklore and melded with superstitions of European settlers in the 19th century. The fear of this werewolf-child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born, which started the practice in 1907 of Argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing.\n\nIn the past half-century, the ceremonies have been opened up to girls and now, for the first time, Jews. The Tawil family appealed to the Argentine government as early as the 1990s to have the practice extended to non-Catholic families. The boy's new status as the president's godson wins him a gold medal as well as a full educational scholarship, according to the Independent.\n\nTales of shape-shifting demons and feral monsters slaughtering livestock can be found in many parts of Latin America. This Argentine iteration can be traced to a local Guarani story of the seven cursed spawn of Tau, an evil mythological spirit, and Kerana, a beautiful woman he seduced and kidnapped. The seventh son was \"Luison,\" who appears sometimes in the shape of a small dog and eats corpses.\n\nSome historians dispute the connection between beliefs about this folk horror and the presidential act of adopting a seventh son as a godson, and suggest the latter is a distinct custom brought over by Eastern European migrants.\n\nAmericans should not be so quick to scoff at the tradition and its embrace by Argentina's head of state.

Outlets around the world ran with the story, explaining the move by citing lingering local superstition about werewolves. In Western folklore, only a werewolf can create another werewolf with its bite, but in Argentina, the story's a little different: the creature is born when a couple gives birth to their seventh son in a row. According to said folklore, seventh sons turn into el lobizon on their 13th birthday if nothing is done about the hereditary curse. Thus, the need for presidential action is pretty clear.\n\n\"The notion of animal shifting came from different Native American traditions,\" Oscar Chamosa, a folklorist at the University of Georgia, told me. \"The idea of el lobison comes from uturunco\u2014or the were-jaguar\u2014which mixed with the European notion of the werewolf.\" Chamosa says he's not sure how the idea was first associated with teenaged boys.\n\nBut even if someone who's devoted his entire life to studying Argentine folklore can't explain it, the teen werewolf thing had become pervasive by the early 20th century, and Catholics in Argentina were producing enough seventh children, that the myth became a public policy problem. After all, terrified parents were (according to legend, at least) regularly committing infanticide.\n\n\"In order to counteract the myth, Argentine presidents have traditionally godfathered any child born into the same family,\" Chamosa explains, adding that the governor of a province or mayor of a village would sometimes officiate for practical reasons. \"The rationale is that the godson of a president would be respected throughout his life despite the suspicion his seventh-male birth position would bring with it.\"\n\nThis idea apparently prevented people from murdering their own babies, so it was a smart move on part of the Argentine government. But if it's surprising people believed in such a curse a century ago, it's downright bizarre that they're still entertaining the notion of it today.\n\nAs per a decree that came out in 1973, adoptees receive a gold medal and a college scholarship. And Argentina is apparently still making new rules about werewolf children, because in 1999 the adoption ceremony was extended to non-Catholics. As the Independent noted, Tawil is the first Jewish boy to receive the honor. So while a werewolf Bar Mitzvah might be a joke on 30 Rock, it's also apparently a real thing that just happened in South America.\n\nThe boy's parents first applied for the medal and scholarship in 1993, but were denied. They applied again after the rules changed to include Jews in 2009. A tweet from President Kirchner's account shows her lighting a menorah with the Tawils, quite the gesture given that the Jewish population of Argentina is less than half of one percent.\n\nJewishpublications are making a big deal out of the historic event, and angry commenters are freaking out about a Jew being adopted\u2014even symbolically\u2014by a non-Jew and the blasphemous concept of a Jewish family taking part in something involving werewolves. (In Jewish folklore, people don't turn into werewolves, and whatever they were before beasthood is never really discussed.)\n\nBut most observers have been glossing over the absolutely fucking strange juxtaposition between a groundbreaking event and an ancient superstition. Like, for instance, that's it's kind of a weird move to progressively bequeath a privilege to a religious minority while tacitly legitimizing the belief that human beings have the ability to transform into mythical creatures that feast on unbaptized babies.\n\nStories about the adoption would also have us believe the president of an industrialized nation believes in werewolves, which is clearly not the case. Although presidents in our own country's recent memory believed they were chosen by God, Chamosa describes Argentina's Kirchner as a nominal Catholic who's a \"progressive left-wing president\u2014more like a Marxist and a secular person in general.\" Much as our Dear Leader pardons a turkey every year, this is an Argentine ritual that's basically a national inside joke.\n\nChamosa says that the werewolf thing has stuck around out of quaint tradition and that the average family in the country today has only two children. For that reason, anyone who achieves an unbroken chain of seven same-sex children is rewarded with the prize.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean there aren't some people in Latin America who still believe in el lobizon.\n\n\"Belief in the healing powers of folk saints and withcraft are pretty much shared across the territory, especially\u2014but not only\u2014in rural areas,\" Chamosa says. \"I would say that only old people still believe [in el lobison]. But you really don't know.\"\n\nFollow Allie Conti on Twitter.","A South African man paid the price for secretly filming he and his girlfriend having sex when she threw acid on his penis.\n\nHumphrey Khoza, 25, lost the use of his penis after his 17-year-old girlfriend confronted him at a bar close to Hazyview, Mpumalanga about the stunt on Jan. 17.

That has drastically curbed demand for HP's desktop and laptop computers, as well as its printers.\n\nThe company said Monday that the PC and printer business will use the name HP Inc. The services business will be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.\n\nFILE - In this Aug. 21, 2012, file photo, the Hewlett-Packard Co. logo is seen outside the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif.

HP PC and printer chief Dion Weisler will be CEO of HP Inc.\n\n\"The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan,\" Whitman said. \"It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics.\"\n\nThe split, if approved by the company board, is expected to close by the end of fiscal 2015. Once complete, HP stockholders will own shares of both companies.\n\nDuring its most recent quarter HP reported revenue of $27.6 billion, a 1 percent annual gain. It marked HP's first year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue since late 2011. Printers and computers contributed 51 percent of the company's quarterly revenue, with the rest coming from technology services like consulting, software and financial programs.\n\nHP is expected to complete the latest round of layoffs, between 11,000 to 16,000 people, this month. That is on top of the 34,000 people it had already jettisoned from its payroll.\n\nAnother tech stalwart announced a split this month. In a bid to drive growth, eBay Inc. said it would spin off its mobile payment service PayPal into a separate and publicly traded company.

Since August, the terrorist group overtaking large swathes of Syria and Iraq, has beheaded two more Americans and a Briton in similar displays of barbarism.\n\nRemains: ISIS militants are allegedly trying to sell the body of beheaded American hostage James Foley for $1million. The photojournalist was executed by the terrorist group this past summer, in a highly-graphic video recording (still from the video above)\n\nVictim: Foley was kidnapped from a cafe in a northwestern Syrian town on November 22, 2012. He was working as a photojournalist covering the civil war at the time\n\nThe three middlemen interviewed by Buzzfeed include a Syrian rebel fighter, a businessman and an official for the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the U.S.-backed rebel group helping to fight ISIS in the civil war-torn country.\n\nThe rebel fighter, who also claimed to have connections to Jubhat al-Nusra (Al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate), called his work 'a humanity case' since he believes returning the body to Foley's parents will help bring them closure.\n\n'They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,' he said. 'They will not give the DNA without the money.'\n\nBut the FSA official warned Buzzfeed against publishing the article, believing the U.S. government would shut the deal down if they found out.\n\nFoley was one of 23 Western hostages held by ISIS earlier this year. Fifteen of the hostages were freed when their respective European governments paid millions of dollars in ransoms, but the British and American hostages were left behind since neither country negotiates with terrorists.\n\nNext offer: Before Foley was executed, ISIS allegedly offered to release him if his family paid a $132million ransom, but the amount was not paid since the U.S. does not negotiate with terrorists. Foley's parents John and Diane speak after the video depicting his beheading was released in August\n\nIt was previously reported that before Foley's death, his family was approached by the group with a $132million ransom to secure their son's release, but that U.S. officials made it clear that if they paid the ransom themselves it would be an act of treason.\n\n'It will be like a shame for the U.S. government,' the FSA official said, of selling the body. 'People will ask why you brought the body but you didn\u2019t bring him when he was alive.'\n\nThe Foley family have not yet commented on the story, and the U.S. State Department told Buzzfeed 'we are seeking more information'.\n\nHolding Western captives for ransom is one of the main ways terrorists groups like ISIS raise money.

Where was the photograph taken? What had happened? Who were the women? Were they teachers? Villagers? Vigilantes? We decided to do a little cyber-sleuthing.\n\nThe first clue was a green, yellow and red football shirt worn by a woman in the back row. The second was a bright blue dress worn by another woman with white patches bearing a symbol in similar shades of green, yellow and red. Could they be colours of a national flag?\n\nThe Nigerian flag is green and white. The flag of neighbouring Benin is green, yellow and red but not all the bands run parallel. The colours also appear in Mali\u2019s flag. Usually they run vertically, not horizontally, as they do in the football shirt. But a Google search for images of \u201cMali football jersey\u201d produced photos of football shirts strikingly similar to that worn by the woman in the back row.\n\nVerifying images\n\nTwo invaluable tools that we regularly use at Africa Check to establish the veracity of photos circulating online are Google\u2019s image search function and the \u201creverse image search\u201d engine, Tineye-com. (For more tips, check out our guide to spotting online fakes and hoaxes.)\n\nWe uploaded the image to Google. The results weren\u2019t encouraging. There were dozens of links to web pages, Facebook posts and tweets all claiming that the photograph showed armed Nigerian women who had fought off Boko Haram. None offered any details of where the picture had been taken and who had taken it.\n\nIn fact, the image had been so widely published in relation to Boko Haram that Google\u2019s suggested search term after we uploaded it was \u201cboko haram women\u201d.\n\nWe changed the search term to \u201cMali\u201d and hit enter.\n\nThe claim is a hoax\n\nAs it turns out, our hunch was correct. The photo was first published on 23 November, 2012 in The Times of London. It had been taken by a Times photographer, Jack Hill, in the town of Sevare in Mali and accompanied an article by one of the newspaper\u2019s correspondents, Jerome Starkey, about \u201cwomen bent on revenge against Tuareg rebels in Mali\u201d.\n\nThe women \u2013 all members of the Ganda Koy militia, a pro-government paramilitary force \u2013 had vowed to avenge relatives they said had been killed or raped by Tuareg rebels belonging to the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA). Few, if any of the women, had seen combat when the photograph was taken.\n\nThe story of the Nigerian teachers standing up to Boko Haram militants is nothing more than a hoax.\n\nA wrap of online fakes and hoaxes\n\nThere are numerous images circulating online that purport to show Boko Haram atrocities. Some are genuine. Many are not.\n\nEarlier this month, the militant group attacked the towns of Doro Gowon and Baga in northern Nigeria. Eyewitnesses say hundreds were killed and satellite images obtained by human rights groups show that dozens of shops, houses and buildings were torched.\n\nIn the weeks since the attack a series of graphic images have spread online as evidence of what has become known as the \u201cBaga massacre\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s our wrap of the images we have fact-checked so far.\n\n(WARNING: Some of the photographs in the links below are extremely graphic.)\n\nOne of the most disturbing photographs shows dozens of charred corpse lying in rows. However the image actually shows the aftermath of a fuel tanker explosion in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2010.\n\nAnother ghastly image shows the burnt corpses of a mother and child. We have been unable to verify its exact origin, but searches on Google and the reverse image search engine, Tineye.com, show that the image has been circulating since at least 2010 and is therefore not from the recent Baga attacks. Given the condition of the bodies, they may have been victims of the fuel tanker explosion, but we cannot say for certain.\n\nYet another photograph attributed to the Baga massacre shows a crowd clustered around a mass grave. However, that image dates from a massacre near the Nigerian city of Jos in March 2010.\n\nThen there is the image of a number of grotesquely mutilated corpses strewn across a road next to a bus. It was actually taken in 2010. According to a BBC report at the time, a series of photographs emerged after armed robbers attacked a bus on the Lagos-Benin highway. The victims had reportedly been made to lie down in the road and then the bus driver was ordered to run them over.\n\nEven a Reuters photograph of a group of men lying face down outside a police station after their arrest in the city of Bauchi in northeastern Nigeria on 25 July 2009 has been passed off as evidence of the Baga massacres and has spread widely on the web and Twitter.\n\nAnother image that has gone viral on Twitter shows a pile of bloodied bodies lying in street. It is also not from Baga but was taken in July 2009 by an Associated Press photographer outside a police station in the town of Maiduguri after clashes between Nigerian troops and Islamist militants left hundreds dead.\n\nNot all the hoaxes involve images of atrocities. A photograph of two men in camouflage uniform being chased by a zebra has been widely distributed as evidence of the Nigerian army\u2019s cowardice. Trouble is, there are no zebras in the wild in Nigeria. It turns out that the photograph was actually taken by a Reuters photographer in Kenya on 30 July 2007. Two Kenya Wildlife Service rangers, working to help move 2,000 animals to the Meru National Park, had to make a run for it when a recalcitrant zebra charged them.\n\n- See more at: http://africacheck.org/reports/story-of-gutsy-bravehearts-fighting-boko-haram-is-a-hoax/#sthash.KsrlgTQO.7zmLUayL.dpuf","Thieves stole a man's penis while he slept, according to police.\n\nFei Lin, 41, of the Niqiao village near Wenling City, in east China\u2019s Zhejiang province, told police he was asleep when the thieves burst into his room and put a bag over his head, according to CEN/EUROPICS and as reported in the Daily Star.\n\n\"They put something over my head and pulled down my trousers and then they ran off,\" Lin said. \"I was so shocked I didn't feel a thing - then I saw I was bleeding and my penis was gone.\"\n\nPolice believe the attackers were jealous lovers of several local women whom Lin was having affairs with, the Austrian Times reported.

Activists demanding free elections for the semi-autonomous territory have been holding their hands up in the air in a symbol of non-violent protest, a gesture many in the US recognize from recent protests in Ferguson, Missouri after an unarmed 18-year-old was shot to death by police.\n\nMost Hong Kong protesters aren\u2019t purposefully mimicking \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot,\u201das some have suggested. Instead, the gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders, who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful intentions to police.\nAsked about any link between the gesture and Ferguson, Icy Ng, a 22-year-old design student at Hong Kong Polytechnic University said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. We have our hands up for showing both the police and media that we have no weapons in our hands.\u201d Ng had not heard of the Ferguson protests. Another demonstrator, with the pro-democracy group Occupy Central, Ellie Ng said the gesture had nothing to do with Ferguson and is intended to demonstrate that \u201cHong Kong protesters are peaceful, unarmed, and mild.\u201d (A more important symbol for the movement may be the umbrella, which protesters have been using to protect themselves against pepper spray and tear gas.)\nStill, the gesture has taken on new meaning for Hong Kong residents whose relationship with the city\u2019s police may never be the same. Hong Kong is one of the most intensively policed cities in the world, with a police force of 30,000 that rivals New York City\u2019s but serves a fraction of New York\u2019s population. The last time Hong Kong authorities used tear gas against demonstrators was in 2005, during demonstrations outside of a World Trade Organization meeting, and in 1967, when leftist activists rioted throughout the city.\nNow, residents are shocked by images of students being tear gassed and elderly demonstrators being pepper sprayed in the face, footage that has prompted more protesters to join demonstrations on Monday.","Freelance journalist Steven Sotloff has reportedly been executed by ISIS, Lee Ferran reported Tuesday for ABC News.\n\nIn the video, which appeared online today, Sotloff addresses the camera, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing.\u201d\n\u201cObama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for preservation of American lives and interests, so why is it that I am paying the price of your interference with my life?\u201d Sotloff says calmly as the black clad militant holds a knife casually at his side.\nOn August 27, Sotloff\u2019s mother, Shirley Sotloff, released a video pleading for her son\u2019s release, Zeke Miller reported for Time.

Brian Sandoval has called press conference Thursday in Nevada's capitol in Carson City where the deal is expected to be announced.\n\nThe plant has been one of the nation's most highly sought projects among state economic development officials. Tesla, which has partnered with Japan's Panasonic, plans to spend $4 billion to $5 billion on the project and employ up to 6,500. The plant will make advanced batteries expected to power Tesla's next generation of electric cars.\n\nTesla recently confirmed that it has been excavating on a site near Reno, but stopped short of saying that it would be the site of the giant plant. In choosing Nevada, Tesla picks a location only a few hundred miles from its main assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., which is close to its corporate headquarters in Palo Alto.\n\nThe announcement comes after a weekend in which California's legislature adjourned without acting on a bill that could have delivered economic incentives to try to lure Tesla into building its battery plant in the Golden State.\n\nBesides Nevada and California, other states named as finalists for the project included Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. Tesla has indicated it may build a second battery factory as well.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said that the company needs the Gigafactory, as he calls it, to dramatically lower the cost of lithium-ion batteries. The maker has indicated it was on a tight schedule to make sure the plant is running in time for start of production of its third model, the Model III, which would be aimed at mass-market car buyers. At present, Tesla makes only a single electric car model, the Model S, and is about to start production of an electric crossover, the Model X. Both of those vehicles, however, are aimed at high-end luxury buyers.\n\nTesla had no official comment Wednesday on the pending announcement.

cannot name the school or those involved as they are all minors, the paper can confirm that, according to Wendy Wilson of the NSPCA, the organisation was called in, in June to handle this situation.When they arrived at the school to investigate, Wendy says she witnessed the children fighting so there can be no doubt that the fights were taking place.While the NSPCA is unsure how long the fighting had been taking place before they were alerted to this cruel \u201cgame\u201d Wendy has confirmed that the NSPCA was contacted by the Springs SPCA last June to make her aware of children at a Springs school imitating dog fights.However, when contacted for comment, Celeste Kleyn, manager from the Springs Springs SPCA, says they are not aware of the incidents.\u201cOur investigations revealed that the children were  engaging in both real dog fighting activities outside of school hours as well as role play whilst at school,\u201d says Wendy.\u201cAnimals fighting always results in animals being harmed and suffering no matter the level of sophistication it is taking place at.\u201cThe issue was brought to our attention by a very observant and proactive principal as there are animal victims involved as well,\u201d Wendy commented adding, \u201c\u201dThe SPCAs mandate is to ensure the welfare of animals as well as their protection.\u201cWere there is animal abuse of this nature you will find co-current abuses of vulnerable humans.\u201dAll the children involved in this situation are of primary school age, and investigations indicated that all these children were first exposed to the activity of dog fighting by either older children or adults in the community during their primary school years.According to Wendy, this is the first time she or her colleagues have come across this type of \u201cdog fighting\u201d with humans acting as the dogs.The NSPCA brought the situation to the attention of the different SAPS Units and Social Services and workshops were conducted with invitations extended to local SAPS, Social Services, Child Protection, Department of Justice, Community leaders, School Principals and local SPCAs.These workshops addressed aspects such as recognising animal cruelty and the link that it has with violence towards humans, dog fighting and other organised animal crime, animal cruelty and children, societies role and responsibility with regards to animal protection in South Africa.Wendy says that the principle ensured the NSPCA that the fighting role play had been stopped at the school but, she says, the children could still be engaging in the activity outside of school hours.When asked about the adults involved, Wendy said that the adults organising the fights are all members of the immediate community and are known dog fighters in the community.She says the children are forced to watch dogs fighting over weekends and then, once at school, are forced to re-enact the fights.The children are also encouraged to bet on the outcome of these fights involving children going down on all fours, growling and snapping at one another, and in some instances injuring one another.Further, it is believed that the prize, for the winning child fighter, is a younger child with whom they are encouraged to \u201cmate\u201d.The truth of this is, however, unclear as Webdy comments: \u201cI saw the act of canine copulation enacted but I do not know how far this is taken when the children are alone.\u201cAs I understand it from the children, different children are used as the female dogs but most often it tends to be the younger ones who are forced into this role.\u201dCaptain Johannes Ramphora, spokesperson for the Springs police told the Addie that he unaware of this situation and whether or not the police are involved in an investigation into the matter.","A 9-year-old girl has stunned her teacher by penning him a touching note after he came out to his class as gay.\n\nThe teacher told the class of primary school

That's until the \"varmala\" ceremony, where the groom garlands his would-be wife, began.\nJust as he extended his arms to do that, Kishore had an epileptic fit, falling to the ground in front of the whole gathering. The young bride, angry that her family had been kept in the dark about Kishore's medical condition, promptly changed her mind and announced that she would happily marry at the same ceremony a guest at the wedding, a man called Harpal Singh. The latter, incidentally, turned out to be her sister's brother-in-law.\nSingh, caught unawares and dressed in jeans and a leather jacket, fumbled for a moment before declaring he would willingly take Indira as his wife. This time the \"varmala\" was exchanged between Singh and Indira, which went off without any hitch, with the pandit reciting the mantras and asking the new couple to take the seven \"pheras\".\nMeanwhile, Kishore, who had been rushed to a doctor by his relatives, went back to the venue after he regained consciousness to see that his wife-to-be was now someone else's.\nKishore pleaded with Indira, telling her that he would not be able to face friends and neighbours if he returned without her. His relatives, too, tried to intervene on his behalf. Where persuasion failed, violence was used \u2014 spoons, plates and dishes became weapons as wedding guests tried to force the bride to change her mind. But all in vain. The young woman stood firm.\nKishore and his relatives later filed an FIR at the Milak police station in Rampur district, which they eventually withdrew after elders intervened. SHO, Milak police station, RP Solanki said on Monday that cops had detained a few people who were there at the wedding. \"Both families have amicably resolved the matter,\" Solanki said. \"The complaints have been withdrawn. Kishore and his family have now returned in peace to Moradabad.\"","Israel's Army Radio reported that al-Sisi had offered Abbas an to extend Sinai and form a Palestinian state.","In what is being called the largest corporate jobs cull in history, IBM is set to axe more than 111,000 of its staff this week.\n\nDubbed Project Chrome internally at IBM, the process will see 26% of the company's workforce laid off in one fell swoop, meaning that 111,800 people could lose their jobs before the end of January based on IBM's global workforce of 430,000.\n\nNews of the job cuts come from veteran Silicon Valley reporter Robert X. Cringely, who recently published a book entitled The Decline and Fall of IBM.\n\nRelatedIBM inks $1.25bn cloud computing deal with WPPLenovo Buys IBM's X86 Server BusinessApple-IBM Deal: Why iPad-Maker is Doubling Down on Enterprise\n\nIn his report on Project Chrome, Cringely says that those affected by the cuts \"will all be gone by the end of February\". He said that while there would be a significant number of jobs lost in the US, the axe would fall on all of IBM's locations around the world. The cuts in the US are likely to affect the company's mainframe and storage divisions most dramatically.\n\nFalling revenue\n\nCurrently the record for the largest single corporate lay-off is also held by IBM, having fired more than 60,000 of its workforce in 1993, but this would be dwarfed if Cringely's predictions come true.\n\nLast year Microsoft hit the headlines when it had its largest ever jobs cull when it laid off more than 18,000 staff in one go.\n\nIBM's problems were underscored last week when it announced another set of weak quarterly revenue figures, its eleventh straight quarter of declining revenue.\n\nFollowing those results, CEO Ginni Rometty said the company was in transition but made no mention of the huge job cuts: \"We are making significant progress in our transformation, continuing to shift IBM's business to higher value, and investing and positioning ourselves for the longer term.\"\n\nIBM's problems stem from the fact that customers are moving their storage infrastructure to the cloud, meaning they no longer need physical data centres on site and therefore don't need service contracts with IBM to help maintain them - a business which accounts for two-thirds of IBM's revenue.","Claim: An aerial photograph shows a giant 50-foot crab off the coast of Whitstable, UK.\n\nPROBABLY FALSE\n\nExample: [Collected via Twitter, October 2014] Crabzilla! Photo appears 2 show giant CRAB measuring at least 50ft across lurking i/t waters off Whitstable\" Really? pic.twitter.com/xzcrZcoY7Q\u2014 Babble (@GibberishBabble) October 13, 2014\n\nOrigins: A photograph of a giant 50-foot crab, dubbed Crabzilla, went viral after it was published in the UK newspaper Sunday Express on 12 October 2014.\n\nThe aerial photograph of Crabzilla was originally posted to Weird Whitstable , a website dedicated to strange sightings in the Kent area, back in 2013. The blog posted a second photo of crabzilla in July 2014 which showed two enormous crab claws reaching out of the water:\n\nThis shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken last weekend. The boys were unaware of the danger, but as several passersby shouted to them, the crab slipped silently away under the water, into the dark, sideways.\n\nQuinton Winter, the curator of Weird Whitstable , told the Express Times that he was skeptical about the photos when he first saw them. That changed last summer, however, when he spotted the giant crab for himself:\n\nAt first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, 'that's a funny looking bit of driftwood.' It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws. Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.\n\nDespite Winter's claim, most likely the Crabzilla photo is just the results of some digital fakery.\n\nAccording to the Marine Biological Association of the UK, the Japanese spider crab is the largest crab species in the world. These crabs can grow up to 3.7 meters across, which, while incredibly large for a crab, is about 11.5 meters (37 feet) smaller than the estimated size of Crabzilla:\n\nThe crab in the viral photo appears to be a cancer pagurus, which is commonly known as a brown or edible crab. These crabs are common in the Whitstable area, but they only grow to about 10 inches wide. Graphic artist Ashley Austen told Kent Online that someone probably used Photoshop and a brown crab image to create the Crabzilla photo:\n\nThe image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop. All the 'artist' had to do is find a suitable image of a crab, overlay it on to the satellite picture of the harbour and apply a few filters to it to get the realistic look.\n\nThere is no other proof confirming that Crabzilla exists. Judging by the image source, the unbelievable size, and the fact that this picture could easily be created with Photoshop, we have to rate the Crabzilla photograph as a likely fake.\n\n&lt;!-- kmn_size = '300x250'; kmn_placement = '1c8834441f20e22a0aef009c095a6cab'; //--&gt;\n\nSources:\n\nBullen, Jamie. \"50ft Crustacean, Dubbed Crabzilla, Photographed Lurking Beneath the Waters.\" Kent Online. 13 October 2014.","Apple may boost the amount of internal RAM and use faster LPDDR4 RAM technology in its next-generation iPhone 6s, claims TechNews Taiwan (via G Gor Games). These RAM modules offer low power consumption and a significant performance increase over the 1GB of LPDDR3 RAM used in the current-generation iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.\n\niphone6-stock\nAccording to supply chain sources, the LPDDR4 RAM modules for the iPhone 6s will be supplied primarily by Hynix, Samsung, and Micron-Elpida. Elpida reportedly was behind schedule, but the company allegedly improved its manufacturing process to a level that will meet Apple's demand. Micron-Elpida and Hynix were identified in iFixit teardown analyses as the RAM suppliers for Apple's current iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models.\n\nApple's next-generation iPhone also is rumored to sport the same design as the iPhone 6 with internal improvements such as an A9 processor and a dual-lens DSLR quality camera. Today's report also hints at the adoption of \"Force Touch\" technology as seen on the Apple Watch to differentiate between quick taps and more forceful presses.\n\nIt is not clear, however, how Apple would implement such a system on the iPhone as it would appear to require a major shift in display technology for the device given that the Apple Watch uses a flexible OLED display paired with electrode sensors to support the Force Touch feature.","Foley's mother and brother claim the US threatened them over ransom payments.","Citigroup analyst Jim Suva weighed in with his expectations for Apple Watch pricing following the news that Apple is hosting a media event on March 9. Apple already announced pricing will start at US$349\u2014presumably for the Apple Watch Sport\u2014and he thinks Apple Watch will cost $550 while the Apple Watch Edition will be priced at $950. He's also pegging April 16 as the smartwatch's official release date.\n\nCitigroup analyst thinks Apple Watch Edition will cost $950, not $5,000Citigroup analyst thinks Apple Watch Edition will cost $950, not $5,000\n\nOn Apple's March 9 media event he said,\n\nWe expect Apple to give specifics on the launch time, price, and geographic locations, which we estimate as: Launch date: April 16th; Price points: $350, $550 and $950; with a launch limited to the U.S., followed by Europe and Asia in the subsequent months.\nSetting Apple Watch Sport at $350 and the standard Apple Watch at $550 falls in line with the general consensus, but the $950 price point he's targeting for Apple Watch Edition comes in well below expectations. Apple Watch Edition ships with a gold body instead of aluminium or stainless steel, and is generally expected to start somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000.\n\nMr. Suva said he expects Apple will offer a wide variety of accessories for Apple watch with bands starting at $29 and topping out in the hundreds of dollars. He also thinks hundreds of apps will be available on launch day.\n\nHe offered up his thoughts on which features we'll see in Apple Watch when it launches saying, \"We expect features to include Apple Pay, adjustable notifications due to personal frequency and preferences, Apple Health, variable haptic feedback, and battery life of one day (under normal use).\"\n\nShoppers hoping to be the first to get an Apple Watch will be able to buy theirs in Apple's own retail stores and through the company's online store. Mr. Suva expects Apple's smartwatch won't be available through other retailers.\n\nApple sent out media invitations on Thursday for a March 9 event teased as \"Spring forward,\" which is a play on the Day Light Saving change happening on March 8, and likely a thinly veiled hint that we'll be getting more Apple Watch news.\n\nWhen Apple first showed off its smartwatch last September, we saw three models with a wide selection of bands, support for tracking basic fitness activity such as steps and distance walked, along with heart rate logging. Apple Watch will also offer Apple Pay support, and will require an iPhone to perform many of its tasks.\n\nMr. Suva has a \"Buy\" rating on Apple's stock along with a $135 target price. Apple is currently trading at $129.59, down 0.82 (0.63%).\n\n[Thanks to Barrons for the heads up]\n\nThe Mac Observer Spin\nMr. Suva's $950 price point for the gold Apple Watch Edition is surprisingly low compared to the general consensus that it won't start below $5,000 and could cost more than $10,000. We'll have to wait until Apple's March 9 media event where Apple Watch pricing is expected to be announced to see how close he really is.","Is it a bird? Is it a plane?

A psychological \u2018cell\u2019 was set up in the police station.\u201d\n\nHelric-Fredou-3\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: It is not yet known to 21WIRE exactly how the fatal gun shot occurred, but if any other past political and high-profile \u2018suicided\u2019 cases are anything to go by, authorities will claim that this victim either shot himself in the back of the head,  with his non-shooting hand. In addition, if that were the case, there would also be a lack of gun powder burns on the hands according to the autopsy.\n\nUK-based investigative reporter Morris108, interviews \u2018Phil in France\u2019 regarding this new development:\n\n\n\n\nEven more bizarrely, an almost identical event took place just over one year earlier, November 2013 in Limoges, when the number 3 ranked SRPJ officer had killed himself in similar circumstances, with his weapon in the police hotel. Allegedly, his colleague discovered his body. The prosecution ruled that case was a suicide too, and the police officer had left a suicide note to his family in which he expressed \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d for his surprising action.\n\nStay tuned for more updates on this story at 21WIRE.\n\nSputnik News\n\nPolice commissioner, who had been investigating the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine committed suicide with his service gun on Thursday night.\n\nPolice commissioner Helric Fredou, who had been investigating the attack on the French weekly satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, committed suicide in his office. The incident occurred in Limoges, the administrative capital of the Limousin region in west-central France, on Thursday night, local media France 3 reports.\nHelric Fredou, 45, suffered from \u2018depression\u2019 and experienced \u2018burn out\u2019 [according to the official statement]. Shortly before committing suicide, he met with the family of a victim of the Charlie Hebdo attack and killed himself preparing the report.\n\nFredou began his career in 1997 as a police officer at the regional office of the judicial police of Versailles. Later he returned to Limoges, his hometown. Since 2012 he had been the deputy director of the regional police service.\n\u201cWe are all shocked. Nobody was ready for such developments\u201d, a representative of the local police union told reporters.\nOn January 7, 2015, two gunmen burst into the editorial office of Charlie Hebdo magazine, known for issuing cartoons, ridiculing Islam. The [suspected] attackers, later identified as brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, killed 12 people and injured 11, and escaped from the scene. Following two days of nationwide manhunt, the suspects were killed on Friday by French police some 20 miles northeast of Paris.","ISIS is trying to sell the remains of beheaded journalist James Foley to his parents or the US government for $1 million, according to a new report.\n\nA source who is a middleman contacted by ISIS to broker the deal told BuzzFeed that the terror group is trying to present it as an act of mercy for the family and a \u201chumanity case,\u201d the Web site said.\n\nThe Islamic fundamentalist group, which has overrun large sections of Iraq and Syria, killing thousands of people in the process, had been financing its military by selling oil produced by the wells in the areas it has captured and by collecting ransom from the governments of its non-American hostages.\n\nBut with the price of crude oil now plummeting and the United States and Britain standing firmly by their policy to not pay ransoms, ISIS \u2014 also known as the Islamic State \u2014 devised the plan to sell the corpse.\n\nISIS beheaded Foley on video last August.\n\nPhotojournalist James Foley talks to reporters from The Associated Press in Boston in 2011.Photo: APIt is offering his family a DNA sample to prove that the body it is holding really is his.\n\n\u201cThey ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,\u201d the source told Buzzfeed. \u201cThey will not give the DNA without the money.\u201d\n\nThe source told the Web site that he is concerned the United States will stop the deal even if the family wants it, because the government nixed a ransom demand before Foley\u2019s death.","Tampa, Fla. (CBS TAMPA) \u2013 A Tampa massage therapist who calls herself \u201cJasmine Tridevil\u201d says she spent $20,000 on a procedure to add a third breast to her chest.\nThe Florida woman told a Florida radio station that she \u201ccalled like 50 or 60 doctors\u201d in order to have the surgery adding a third breast. The 21-year-old says she saved up for two years for the surgery that she hopes will land her a reality television show on MTV. Tridevil says it\u2019s not just fame and fortune that pushed her to have the surgery \u2013 it was also a desire to rebuff men\n\u201cMy whole dream is to get this show on MTV,\u201d she told Real Radio. \u201cI got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don\u2019t want to date anymore\u2026 Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know\u2026 feel pretty.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m through.\u201d\nLast month, she uploaded a YouTube video of herself modeling in a bikini as Radiohead\u2019s \u201cCreep\u201d plays in the background.\nHer \u201cJasmine Tridevil\u201d social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram have received reactions of disbelief \u2013 and support \u2014 at her selfie photographs featuring her in bikinis and other outfits displaying her third breast. She said she made many of her own outfits for herself.\nTridevil received the surgery a few months prior, although \u201cit was really hard finding someone that would do it because they\u2019re breaking the code of ethics,\u201d she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non-disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery.\nAlthough the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola, Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo.\nTridevil said she was filmed when she told her parents about the surgery in hopes that the video will be featured on her own reality show. She says she personally hired the camera crew to film her after more than two years of saving money.\n\u201cMy mum ran out the door. She won\u2019t talk to me. She won\u2019t let my sister talk to me. My dad \u2026 he really isn\u2019t happy \u2026 he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy dad is still there for me.\u201d\n\u2013 Benjamin Fearnow","Oct 6 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.\n\nHP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year.\n\nShares of the company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, were up 5.1 percent at $37 in premarket trading on Monday.\n\nEach of the two businesses contribute about half of HP's current revenue and profit.\n\nThe move will result in a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue the fiscal year ending October.\n\n\"Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates,\" Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement.\n\nRelational owns a 1.49 percent stake in HP, which had a market value of about $66 billion as of Friday.\n\nMany investors and analysts had called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the personal computer business, so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations of providing computer servers, networking and data storage to businesses.\n\nHP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses.\n\nOnline auction company eBay Inc said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.\n\nWHITMAN TO LEAD ENTERPRISE\n\nHP's current chief executive, Meg Whitman, will lead the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, which will house the corporate hardware and services operations.\n\nCurrent HP lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company.\n\nHP's printing and personal computing business, to be known as HP Inc, will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division. Whitman will be chairman of HP Inc.\n\nFounded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution.\n\nLately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals such as Chinese PC maker Lenovo, which is now the world's No. 1 PC maker by shipments.\n\nDell Inc, which is HP's closest U.S. competitor and facing similar pressure, was taken private by founder Michael Dell last year.\n\nHP's PC business has shown signs of life in recent quarters, growing broadly geographically as businesses replace aging machines.\n\nHP on Monday affirmed its fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings of $3.70 to $3.74 per share. It also forecast 2015 adjusted earnings of $3.83-$4.03 per share, in line with the average analyst estimate of $3.95, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nHP's announcement on Monday confirmed a report of the split in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.\n\nUp to Friday's close, HP's stock had risen nearly 26 percent this year.

None of them were 'handed over' in any way to anyone. The destruction of weapons at the embassy and the airport was carried out in accordance with an approved destruction plan,\" the statement read.\n\nThe statement continued: \"To be clear: No Marine handed a weapon to a Houthi, or had one taken from him.\"\n\nThe previous night, embassy officials burned tens of thousands of documents and destroyed weapons that were inside the Sanaa embassy's storage warehouses, Yemeni employees of the embassy said.\n\nWhat you need to know about Yemen\n\nYemen has been an important country to the United States as the home of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the most feared, influential and operational terrorist organizations in the world. U.S. officials have had a long relationship with Yemeni leaders, working with them to target AQAP militants.\n\nBut now, Yemen's latest leader, President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, is gone, having resigned after Houthi rebels seized control of key government facilities, dissolved parliament and placed him under house arrest.\n\nAll this movement has left the Houthis -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- as the pre-eminent power in Yemen.\n\nTheir takeover hasn't been smooth and it's not clear whether it will ever be complete. There has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the south, where there's a long-running secessionist movement, and in the oil-rich province of Marib to the east of Sanaa.\n\nThen there's the question of what it means for the United States and its anti-terrorism efforts.\n\nU.S. special forces stay in Yemen\n\nAs of last month, U.S. officials hadn't engaged in talks with the Houthis, though there were discussions about whether to talk to them.\n\nStill, even amid the turmoil, the U.S. military remains active in Yemen.\n\nTake, for instance, the killing of senior AQAP cleric Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari and three other people in a drone strike on their vehicle on January 31.\n\n\"They are still capable of conducting counterterrorism operations in Yemen, and frankly ... there's some counterterrorism training that's still ongoing ... with Yemeni security forces,\" said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman.\n\n\"I'd be less than honest if I said that there hadn't been some adjustments already made because of the political uncertainty,\" he said. \"We're just going to have to watch this closely going forward.\"\n\nYemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against AQAP, which has been tied to the failed attempt by \"underwear bomber\" Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab and Fort Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Hasan. More recently, the terror group has been linked to the slaughter at French magazine Charlie Hebdo.\n\n\"They are a very dangerous group,\" said Kirby. \"They do want to threaten Western interests, including U.S. interests, and we do consider them a threat to the United States of America. We're watching them very closely.\"\n\nJournalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Yemen, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote in Atlanta.

Now there are reports stating that through their Samsung Display arm they may become a future supplier to Apple for displays of the Apple watch. The report also states that LG Display will actually be the first provider of the OLED displays that the Apple watch is said to be using. LG Display also currently makes displays for the iPad.\n\nAs we stated above this wouldn\u2019t be the first time that we\u2019ve seen Apple work alongside its competitors, let alone two of its biggest competitors, to bring one of its own devices to market. Apple of course, had to get the Apple watch displays from somewhere because they don\u2019t make their own displays for their products, and seeing as how both Samsung and LG have already produced more than one smartwatch themselves along with the displays on them, should these rumors be true it actually makes a lot of sense. Currently the Apple Watch isn\u2019t available, but it is reportedly going on sale this year in April, and for the time being the rumor states that LG will be the sole supplier at first.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, is that Samsung is reported to be joining in on the display sales sometime as early as the second half of 2015 or very early 2016 potentially for the next version of the Apple watch, although at this point in time Samsung and LG have both declined to comment on these rumors stated in the South Korean media. Apple has kept quiet on the matter as well. Whether or not there is any truth to these rumors seems to be uncertain for now, but knowing that Apple buys display tech from LG Display already, the rumors are reasonable enough to be at least plausible and it\u2019s certainly possible for LG Display to make more screens for other Apple products.","The 80-year-old and bride-to-be Afton Elaine Burton were granted permission late last year to get hitched - but it hasn't gone ahead\n\nVIEW GALLERY\n\nCharles Manson was being married for money not love after his fiancee only wanted the wedding so she could cash in on his corpse, it has been claimed.\n\nA new book alleges the serial killer's engagement to Afton Elaine Burton was part of a crazy scheme of hers to make money by putting his body on public display after his death.\n\nAccording to journalist Daniel Simone, the 27-year-old sought to wed the mastermind of the Helter Skelter murders so she could gain possession of his remains when he died.\n\nSimone claims Burton, known as Star, and her friend, Craig Hammond, planned to lay out Manson\u2019s remains in a glass crypt.\n\nThe pair began concocting their ghoulish plot over two years ago believing their bizarre tomb would draw huge crowds and make big money.\n\nMarriage Off: Charles Manson has refused to marry Afton Burton despite being granted a marriage license\n\nHowever Manson, 80, who recently refused to marry Burton after the pair were granted a marriage licence, is alleged to have discover the plot and wanted not further part.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s finally realised that he\u2019s been played for a fool,\u201d Simone said.\n\nInitially, Burton and Hammond had asked the killer to sign a document that would let them take his body when he dies.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give them a yes, he didn\u2019t give them a no.

Sotloff appears to be authentic, U.S. officials said Wednesday as President Obama said America would not be \u201cintimidated\u201d by Islamic State militants.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. intelligence community has analyzed the recently released video showing U.S. citizen Steven Sotloff and has reached the judgment that it is authentic,\u201d said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden.\n\nSotloff\u2019s family, through a spokesman, issued a statement suggesting they believed the footage to be authentic as well. \u201cThe family knows of this horrific tragedy and is grieving privately,\u201d said the spokesman, Barak Barfi.\n\nIt was the second such killing carried out by Islamic State militants. Late last month, American journalist James Foley was beheaded in a similar videotaped slaying.\n\nIn Estonia, Obama vowed to \u201cdestroy\u201d the Islamic State militants and said the United States would \u201cnot be intimidated\u201d by the bloodshed.\n\nThe Sotloff video, which surfaced online Tuesday, shows a bound and kneeling Sotloff being held at knife-point by a black-clad militant against a desert backdrop similar to the one shown in an earlier video depicting the beheading of Foley.\n\nThe gruesome killings and the group\u2019s threat to decapitate other captives put new pressure on the Obama administration at a time when it is weighing how the United States should respond to an al-Qaeda offshoot that is seen as ruthless but that has not carried out plots beyond the region.\n\nThe United States has carried out more than 100 airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq over the past month since the group expanded its control of territory there. But the administration has avoided direct U.S. military involvement in Syria aside from a failed attempt to rescue Foley and other captives earlier this year.\n\nThe Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies have developed lists of possible Islamic State targets in Syria. But Obama, who has expressed concerns about being drawn into Syria\u2019s civil war, indicated last week that he had not yet approved new strikes. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a strategy yet,\u201d Obama said in a remark that was later derided by Republican lawmakers and critics.\n\nU.S. officials believe that as many as a dozen Americans may be fighting alongside the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and that the group holds at least two other American hostages, both aid workers.\n\nSotloff, a 31-year-old freelance journalist, had written for Time magazine, Foreign Policy and other publications. He was believed to have been taken captive shortly after entering Syria in 2013, and he was shown in the video of Foley that the Islamic State released last month. Sotloff\u2019s mother, Shirley, recently  released a video pleading with the group for her son\u2019s release.\n\nIn the video, an unidentified militant denounces the Obama administration, saying, \u201cI\u2019m back, Obama, and I\u2019m back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State.\u201d He cites recent U.S. airstrikes against the group in Iraq and warns that \u201cjust as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.\u201d\n\nThe militant speaks with a British accent, raising the possibility that he is the same person who killed Foley, 40. Both hostages wore orange jumpsuits, much like prisoners held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nFoley and Sotloff may not have been killed at the same time or place. The militant in the Sotloff video appears to refer to U.S. airstrikes at Amerli in Iraq, which began over the weekend. Sotloff also appears to have more hair on his head and face than in the first video.\n\nThe latest video, obtained by the Site Intelligence Group, an organization that tracks the online postings of Islamist militant groups, also shows another hostage identified as David Cawthorne Haines. Haines is a British aid worker who was abducted in March 2013 near the Atmeh refu\u00adgee camp adjoining the Turkish border and the Syrian province of Idlib, according to aid workers involved in efforts to secure his release.\n\nIn an apparent reference to Britain, Sotloff\u2019s killer warns \u201cgovernments that enter this evil alliance of America . . . to back off and leave our people alone.\u201d Haines is shown in the same kneeling position and wearing the same type of orange jumpsuit as Sotloff and Foley before him.\n\nSotloff had traveled into and out of Syria several times before he was abducted after entering the country from Turkey on Aug. 4, 2013, according to a person familiar with the details of his case. The Florida native had covered turmoil in countries including Egypt and Libya, where his reporting served as the basis of a Time magazine reconstruction of the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on U.S. compounds in Benghazi.\n\nIn the video that surfaced Tuesday, Sotloff stares stone-faced into the camera while delivering a statement apparently scripted by his captors. \u201cI am Steven Joel Sotloff,\u201d he says, adding that he is \u201cpaying the price\u201d for the Obama administration\u2019s policies in the Middle East.\n\nThe video lasts less than three minutes but appears to have been carefully produced by the terrorist group, which has used online propaganda to position itself as a successor to al-Qaeda and declare itself the leader of a new Islamic caliphate.\n\nThe recording opens with footage of Obama\u2019s remarks after Foley\u2019s death, then cuts to video of Sotloff taken from two camera angles.

The country\u2019s national airline is introducing new seating assignments that will be based on gender separation. The commercial flight service, in keeping with Saudi Islamic law, is responding to complaints from passengers about males sitting next to their wives, according to a Daily Mail news report.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s national airline fielded a string of complaints from a number of male fliers who are protesting other males sitting next to their spouses and other female relatives. Accordingly, the airline met over creating rules for passengers in order to remain in strict compliance with laws that govern Islam in the Gulf kingdom.\n\nWomen soon to be segregated aboard Saudi planes.\n\nFuture plans are to institute segregation rules aboard Saudi Arabia Airlines flights. In short, males and females will not be allowed to sit adjacent to one another unless they are closes relatives. The concern is that the rules will clash with passengers who represent other nationalities and do not practice Islamic laws. Saudi assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd weighed in on the subject.\n\n\u201cThere are solutions to this problem\u2026we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.\u201d\n\nAlthough the new plans for separating men and women aboard flights is part of a new initiative, most Saudi Arabia customs are already practiced aboard commercial airlines in the region. Several examples; pork dishes and alcohol, which are served aboard passenger planes in the West and other nation states, are forbidden on Middle Eastern and Sharia observant flights. Additionally, a verse from the Qur\u2019an is read with accompanying an prayer before every flight, and international flights offer an on-board prayer room for men only.\n\nAlthough the country does not allow Saudi women to work as cabin crew members, they employ the services of women from other countries. Moreover, Saudi Arabia Airlines\u2019 segregation extends to the ground. In November, the company opened its fourth all-women office in the Murooj district of Saudi capital, Riyadh, wrote DM.\n\nSome say the move to segregate women and men aboard Saudi airliners violates United Nations laws on human rights. Nonetheless, practitioners of Islamic law point to custom and religion, saying it\u2019s not used to oppress women.\n\nStill, many others say it\u2019s pure gender inequality and has no place in the modern world. It\u2019s known that women in Gulf states are required to enter and exit using special doors in public spaces. Months ago, Inquistir reported that women with \u201cpretty eyes\u201d are being forced to cover them up to prevent temptation.\n\nAdditionally, women are forbidden to socialize with another male unless he is a close relative. If she does, charges can include prostitution, fornication and adultery. The penalties are harsh and can include stoning and death. The new Saudi Arabian airline segregation policy will undoubtedly fan the flames in the ongoing debate between what many view as oppressive religious laws and human rights.\n\n[Image via: Carbonated.TV, MyPlaneWorld]","TORPOINT \u2014 No one likes getting bills, but one bill in particular has a family in Torpoint completely shocked.\n\nAccording to the Plymouth Herald, it all happened after 5-year-old Alex Nash was invited to a friend\u2019s birthday party at a ski and snowboarding facility.\n\nAfter Alex was invited to the bash, Nash\u2019s parents told his friend\u2019s mother he would attend the party.

TechCrunch reports that Apple plans to eliminate the Beats Music streaming service, which it acquired in May, but doesn\u2019t say when. The report is less clear on what Apple plans to do with streaming music. Once source tells TechCrunch that on-demand music could be integrated into iTunes; another source says Apple will make a \u201csignificant music announcement\u201d in the first half of 2015.\n\nEngineers from Beats Music have already been transferred to other divisions at Apple, including iTunes, according to the report. As TechCrunch notes, Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers was put in charge of Apple\u2019s ad-supported iTunes Radio product in August and has been splitting his time between the services since then.\n\nWhen Apple bought the Beats brand for $3 billion, Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue called Beats Music \u201c the first music subscription service done right .\u201d Though it mostly mimicked existing services from Spotify, Rdio, and others, Beats Music tried to differentiate itself through hand-curated playlists and the involvement of music-industry titans like Dr. Dre and Trent Reznor.

Still, Cue had positioned Beats as a key component of Apple\u2019s music strategy, saying that the company wanted to offer on-demand listening along with ad-supported radio and digital downloads.\nAll of which suggests that while the Beats Music brand may be going away, on-demand streaming from Apple could easily take another form.

The dear leader\u2019s health problems have reached the point where he now walks with a limp.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s service to the world.\n\nThe cheese is called Emmental, commonly known as Swiss cheese, and Kim Jong Un is so addicted to the cheese that he has it imported despite multiple sanctions.\n\nThe extent of Kim\u2019s obesity and consequent health problems became apparent at a recent ceremony in Pyongyang. Kim Jong Un was appearing to remember the passing of his grandfather Kim Il-Sung, the founder of the modern North Korean state. Kim\u2019s face was swollen, and the dear leader walked with a limp, according to a TV appearance.\n\nHis appearance may have honored Kim Il Song in more ways than one. The founder of North Korea was also overweight, and some have suggested the Kim Jong Un stuffs himself to keep up the family image.\n\nAs defector Cho Myung-Chu explained,\n\n\u201cNorth Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny. There is a high chance Jong-un intentionally gained weight to look like Il-sung.\u201d\n\nKim Jong Un has even tried to enroll North Korean cooks in European cheese making classes and sent envoys to France. The Europeans politely declined rather than having their cheese making technology stolen.\n\nForeign policy or luxury shopping list?\n\nCheese isn\u2019t the only luxury the dear leader has a taste for. As previously reported by the Inquisitr, North Korea came out in support of Scottish Independence. The reason? So they could get a hold of real Scotch.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s still a long shot if an independent Scotland would ever conduct trade with the rogue state, but in the end Kim Jong Un has other ways.\n\nOffice 39, the North Korean agency responsible for foreign currency reserves, has control of an unknown number of foreign trade companies that manage to allude authorities and skirt international sanctions. That might all change soon as the agency has been struggling with management since the execution of Kim Jong Un\u2019s uncle Jang Song-thaek, who was believed to the be the head of the financial institution.\n\nLifting the sanctions may do more to eliminate the dear leader than Seth Rogen and James Franco ever could.\n\nIf Kim Jong Un continues to consume Swiss cheese as at a rapid pace, the dictator may be in capable of ruling much longer.\n\n[Image Credit: Wikimedia/wallpaperseries.com]","You've heard of the third nipple \u2014 but what about a third breast?\n\nA Tampa massage therapist, Jasmine Tridevil, underwent surgery to get just that.

In a new report, The Wall Street Journal offers a look at the original Apple Watch health features that were dropped due to consistency problems.\n\nApple began developing the watch about four years ago, with a focus on health and fitness. It\u2019s not unusual for Apple to experiment with many technologies or shift focus during product development, but the watch was especially challenging, people familiar with the matter said. Internally, the project became known as a \u201cblack hole\u201d sucking in resources, one of these people said.The Apple Watch originally featured sensors that measured the conductivity of skin, allowing the device to detect stress levels and heart-rate monitoring similar to an electrocardiogram, also known as an EKG. Apple also experimented with ways to detect blood pressure or how much oxygen is in a user's blood. However, a mix of consistency problems and potential oversight caused Apple to switch the focus of the device from health-related to a more general do-everything product.\n\nThe skin conductivity features didn't perform well with people who had hairy arms or dry skin, while results varied depending on how tight an Apple Watch was worn on users' wrists. Additionally, if Apple decided to use the health data to provide \"health or behavioral advice\", the Cupertino company would have to seek approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulators.\n\nWhile these features were dropped for the first version of the Apple Watch, sources tell the WSJ that they could appear in future versions of the device, echoing a Reuters report from September.\n\nLast week, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company's objective with Apple Watch is to \"change the way people live their lives\" and that people would be surprised by the breadth of what the device can do, which includes activity monitoring, reminding users to stand up after a certain time period, and non-verbal communication with friends. Apple is currently asking developers to have their Apple Watch apps ready by mid-February, with some developers traveling to Apple's Cupertino headquarters for help.\n\nCook has confirmed the Apple Watch will launch in April. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple will make five to six million units for the first quarter, with half of those units being the entry Apple Watch Sport and one-third being the mid-tier stainless-steel Apple Watch.\n\nRelated roundup: Apple Watch , Tag: wsj.com","The woman who claimed she had a third breast was lying and the story is a hoax.","Three Afghanistan National Army soldiers who went missing Saturday night from a Regional Cooperation training exercise at Camp Edwards in Sandwich have been found on near the Canadian border, according to sources close to the investigation.\n\nDetails on where the men were found, as well as whether they have been detained, have not been provided.\n\nThe three men are senior military officers from Afghanistan and were cleared by the US State Department to participate in the exercise, according to Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. James Sahady. They were identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt.

Magnier, Al Rai's chief international correspondent, said Mr Alhakim\u2019s claims should be treated cautiously. He told The Independent: \u201cIsis doesn't have the market in this current global war against it to be engaged in this business [organ harvesting]. This requires contacts that Isis is losing.\u201d\n\nAn Isis fighter was also quick to deny claims made by Mr Alhakim, saying the group would not have time to collect the organs of those they killed.\n\nHe was quoted by Mr Magnier as saying: \u201cIf [these claims were] true, this would be a general policy for Isis that it would not be possible to hide.\n\n\"People are shot in the head, beheaded, bodies thrown in the desert, others left in the battle field and more were dropped in deep wells. Fighters don't have the time to stop in the battle field and collect bodies of their own fighters.\n\n\u201cSo how could we collect bodies of those we kill and transport them to sell their organs? \"\n\nAnother fighter said it would be easier to harvest organs from prisoners but the group chooses not to, saying: \u201cOrgans are preserved naturally in prisoners and could be harvested when needed.\n\n\"It is easier to harvest organs from prisoners than from the dead, which is not the case.\"\n\nThe militant stressed that organ-selling would not raise substantial funds to maintain the group, saying: \u201cThe West is trying to find out where our funding comes from.

And why not\u2014it's internet gold! Also, as it turns out, not even remotely true.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the story of the day is as follows:\n\nA tradition holds that the seventh son of a family is doomed to turn into a werewolf \u2014 known as \"el lobison\" in Argentina \u2014 after his 13th birthday and will stalk the night in its beastly form, feeding on the dead and murdering all before it.... The fear of this werewolf-child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born, which started the practice in 1907 of Argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing.\nWhile, yes, seventh sons and daughters in Argentina are eligible to become the godson or goddaughter (read: not the adopted child) of the country's president, as The Guardian points out, Jewish werewolf-hood has no part in the tradition. Which is fairly evident from Argentinian President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner's tweets depicting the country's newly announced first Jewish godson.\n\nTop translation: They brought me a menorah. They asked me to light it. Bottom translation: I didn't realize it, but their visit coincided with Hanukkah.\n\nBut, as The Guardian points out, this nice, totally innocuous event somehow got mixed up with an ancient, werewolf-esque myth called the lobiz\u00f3n:\n\nBut somehow, the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobiz\u00f3n(Argentina's equivalent to the European werewolf). According to some versions of the myth, the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse.\n\nEvidently, the chance meeting of a Latin American president with a colorful myth too good to fact-check proved irresistible \u2013 confirming as it did any number of stereotypes about erratic behavior from national leaders in the continent of magical realism.\n\nIn fact, the only connection between the two tales is that they center around seventh children. There is an actual, century-old tradition in which every seventh child born to an Argentinian family is eligible to become the president's godchild\u2014a practice originating from Czarist Russia. The tale of the lobiz\u00f3n, on the other hand, started amongst Argentina's gauchos and has nothing whatsoever to do with the president's newly minted godson.\n\nSo sorry to burst your bubble, internet\u2014no werewolf Jewish godsons this time.

Belief in the legend was once so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.\nUnder the law, the boys receive presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday. Until 2009, the law only applied to Catholic boys.\nShlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson.\nOn Tuesday, he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina\u2019s history. Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together.\nThe president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a \u201cmagical moment\u201d with a \u201cmarvelous family.\u201d She described Yair as \u201ca total sweety,\u201d and his mother a \u201cQueen Esther.\u201d\nShe tweeted that the Tawils \u201care a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.\u201d The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.\nCORRECTION: The original brief stated incorrectly that Shlomo Tawil was the director of the Chabad House in Rosario, located in central Argentina.

This raises the question of whether buyers \u00a0are enabled to color-adjust the crown.\n\nThere are several ways, as Six Colors is mentioning. The first would be very interesting, but it is extremely unlikely: Accordingly, the crown could have a small LCD screen that when you change the bracelet, it displays the corresponding color. Much more plausible, however, the idea that when you buy a color, the point can be selected which should appear on the crown. This would be independent of the bracelet. In addition, it may possible Apple allows a replacement of the crown, so that the color can be changed as needed.\n\nIn the end, however, we can only speculate. Only at the official launch, we'll be able to\u00a0have certainty. There are also signs that only at the Apple Watch Edition this may possible, other versions will probably have to life\u00a0without such an option.\n\nTherefore, there are still some question marks regarding the Apple Watch.","White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough says no threats were made to the families of slain U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff for considering ransom payments to their captors.

Come and examine them. It is clear they are missing certain parts.'\n\nHe also said a dozen doctors have been 'executed' in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.\n\nMr Alhakim briefed the UN Security Council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of 'crimes of genocide' in targeting certain ethnic groups.\n\nThe outgoing UN envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, also told the council that last month alone, 790 people were killed by terrorism and armed conflict in the country.\n\nHe also noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that IS is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that 'it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day'. He used an acronym for the group.\n\nMaking them rich: Mohamed Alhakim claimed that dozens of bodies with surgical incisions and missing body parts have been found in shallow mass graves near ISIS stronghold Mosul (pictured) over the past few weeks\n\nMr Mladenov said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that ISIS has seized over the past year.\n\nThe Sunni militants currently controls around a third of both Iraq and neighbouring Syria and imposed its strict interpretation of Sharia law in its self-declared caliphate - subjecting a population of around four million people to a brutal campaign of rape and massacre.\n\n'Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,' Mr Mladenov said, using an alternative acronym for the group known as ISIS in the West and Daesh in Arab nations.\n\nThe shocking news of ISIS trade in human organs was first revealed in a report by al-Monitor news website in December, citing an Iraqi ear, nose and throat doctor named Siruwan al-Mosuli.\n\nHe told the site that ISIS commanders hired foreign doctors to run an extensive organ trafficking system from a hospital in Mosul that is already beginning to generate huge profits.\n\nMilitants: Each of the letters is signed with a purple stamp, indicating the province from which it was sent.

'Information then leaked about organ selling.'\n\nThe report went on: 'Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.'\n\nMost of the organs are then smuggled out of Syria and Iraq into neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia or Turkey where criminal gangs sell them on to shady buyers across the globe, the Assyrian International News Agency reported.\n\nWhile organ harvesting may be the most shocking of IS' revenue streams, the report highlights a string of others that contribute to the group's $2million annual income.\n\nSecurity: ISIS' horrifying trade in human organs, which was revealed by MailOnline last December, is just the latest way for the terrorist organisation to finance its activities, with other major sources of the group's $2 million-a-day income being the sale of oil, ransom payments, and smuggled antiques\n\nIntelligence chiefs are investigating claims the Islamic State jihadi who led the executions of 21 Egyptians was an American recruit.\n\nThe militant, who spoke English with a U.S. accent, appeared in a horrific video on Sunday showing the beheadings of a group of Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya.\n\nBrandishing a knife, he declares: 'All crusaders... the sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah we will mix it with your blood.'\n\nThe men are then forced to lie face-down before they are beheaded simultaneously.\n\nU.S. officials are understood to be analysing the militant's facial features and speech patterns as has been done in the hunt for the British executioner known as Jihadi John, who has appeared in a number of beheading videos in Syria.\n\nProfessor Erik Thomas, a linguistics expert at North Carolina State University, believes he 'sounds like an American' with some Arabic influence, based on some of word pronunciations.\n\nOne tactic is smuggling families and individuals into other countries. The report highlights one instance when a family paid ISIS over $8,000 per individual to sneak them into Turkey.\n\nDrug smuggling is another. Al Monitor's report claims that IS traffics Afghan heroin into Europe from the city of Nineveh, which the Russian Federal Drug Control Service (RFDCS) says is generating 'significant revenues.'\n\nIts drug business has become so successful in recent months that the RFDCS claims that IS now supplies half of Europe's entire heroin market.\n\nYesterday it was revealed that militants fighting for ISIS in Syria are making millions of pounds selling ancient statues and mosaics to wealthy Westerners using a complex system of smugglers and middle men.\n\nLooted from ancient buildings in ISIS strongholds, such as the group's de facto capital city Raqqa, the antiquities are up to 10,000-years-old and can exchange hands for more than $1 million each.\n\nThe most expensive items are covertly smuggled overseas - usually on the orders of wealthy Europeans - but there is also a lucrative trade in less historically important objects, which often find their way into tourist shops and markets in neighbouring Lebanon and Turkey.\n\nThe trade in antiquities is one of ISIS' primary sources of funding, along with oil and ransom payments, and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year.\n\nThe finer points of ISIS trade in antiquities was uncovered in an investigation by the BBC.\n\nIt revealed that ISIS militants charge smugglers 20 per cent on the sale of ancient items found or looted in territory under its control. If the smugglers decide not to buy the items, they are promptly smashed to pieces as examples of idolatry, regardless of their historic significance.","In a bid to finance its operations, the Islamic State group might be harvesting human organs, Iraq\u2019s ambassador to the U.N. told the intergovernmental organization on Tuesday, and asked the Security Council to investigate the allegations.\n\nIn the past few weeks, authorities have discovered bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other organs in several shallow mass graves, leading many to believe that the extremist group might be harvesting these organs to fund its caliphate, Mohamed Alhakim, the Iraqi envoy to the U.N., reportedly said.\n\n\u201cWe have bodies.

The analyst also predicted that iPhone shipments would beat expectations for Q1 2015 with over 61 million units shipped, while iPad shipments are expected to total to 10 million units.\n\nKuo notes that Apple may reveal more details about the Apple Watch before its official launch, revealing specifics on battery life and the start of pre-orders. Most components of the Apple Watch will see high shipments during the quarter, but other key components are expected to see low production yields which may cause a constrained supply. Kuo predicts that Apple will ship 2.8 million Apple Watch units in Q1 2015, and his estimate for a March launch falls in line with previous reports.\n\nRendering of 12-inch MacBook Air done by Martin Hajek\nKuo's estimate for a Q1 2015 launch of the new 12-inch MacBook Air falls in line with a report earlier this month which stated that Apple supplier Quanta Computer was ramping up production of the notebook for a release this quarter. The 12-inch MacBook Air is expected to feature a new ultra-thin, fan-less design with a high resolution Retina display and a low-power Intel Core M processor. The notebook is also said to be one of the first to take advantage of the new reversible USB Type C connector, which may also be used for charging.\n\nRelated roundups: MacBook Air, Apple Watch , Tags: KGI Securities, Ming-Chi Kuo","Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) is a young lady from Tampa, Florida.\n\nHere is a troubling radio interview with her about why she allegedly got a third breast a few months ago and how hard it was to get one.

A recent report suggests that an NHL team coming to Las Vegas isn't so much a pipe dream as it is a certainty.\n\nTony Gallagher of the Vancouver Province reported that commissioner Gary Bettman, who has so often said \u201cwe're not looking to expand\u201d or \u201cwe have no plans for expansion\u201d so many times over the last decade, is changing his tune on expansion.\n\nMore from the Province:\n\n\u2026Recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if, but when [the league will expand].\n\nAnd then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two?\n\nSources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.\n\n\u201cDone deal.\u201d Sounds almost too good to be true and it may be, but there has been movement on the expansion front recently.\n\nUPDATE: NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly denied the report Wednesday morning in comments to TVA Sports:\n\n\"[Expansion to Las Vegas is] not in our plans, there is absolutely nothing new in that,\" he has admitted to TVASports.ca.\n\nAnd if it were an organization struggling with financial difficulties, as the Florida Panthers, who moved rather in the \"Sin City\"?\n\n\"We have no move in sight, whether in the case of the Panthers, or any other team besides,\" replied Daly.\n\nEven in light of the league's denial, there's still reason to believe the NHL will have to soon expand and cities like Las Vegas and another rumored candidate Seattle would help expand the league's footprint.\n\nHere's why it's not completely outlandish to envision Vegas as a future NHL city. For one, they have two open spots in the Western Conference to even things out and bring some competitive balance. The Eastern Conference currently has 16 teams, while the West has 14. If the NHL expanded to the most long-rumored top candidate of Seattle, that would help even things out. It's definitely not as simple as that, though.\n\nAnother barrier for Las Vegas would have been an arena, but that may no longer be an issue. The city has been home to minor-league hockey for years, but now Vegas is in the process of building a new arena however with the aim of bringing either an NHL or NBA team to Vegas.\n\nMGM and AEG, owner of the Los Angeles Kings, are teaming up on the project that broke ground in Las Vegas in May. The new arena is due to open in 2016 and will have 20,000 seats, but a projected capacity of 17,500 for hockey. The company building the arena, ICON, is also building the Edmonton Oilers' new arena. Kings great Luc Robitaille was on hand at the ground-breaking.\n\nThere has long been a desire for Las Vegas to finally get a major league franchise and there are likely more than a few individuals out there that would be willing to bet on Sin City to support a big team.\n\nBut here are the issues that make it seem a little less likely. There are other markets like Quebec City or Southern Ontario, that have long been pushing for NHL teams and would appear safer bets than Las Vegas. Putting teams in Seattle and Las Vegas would help even out the Western conference, but there could be an uproar if the NHL goes to two more non-traditional markets while strong Canadian markets exist to make money hand over fist.\n\nA recent report from CBC suggested that Canada could support three more NHL teams. The league undoubtedly knows that they could get a lot out of more Canadian markets and also have that new TV rights deal with Rogers, a company that would no doubt love more Canadian markets.\n\nThat's where a second report comes in regarding expansion. Howard Bloom of SportsBusinessNews.com reported that the NHL will expand by four teams including Las Vegas, Seattle, Quebec City and Toronto.\n\nUpdate: In light of Daly's comments, the timeline sure doesn't seem to add up on this one, but it is hardly surprising that the league would come out in strong denial. With expansion \"not in the plans\" now, it doesn't mean it can't be eventually, and possibly soon.\n\nA $1.4 billion figure for combined expansion fees seems a bit high. The last time the NHL expanded between 1997 and 2000, expansion fees were a reported $80 million, which was a $30 million difference from the previous high. In the 14 years since, you better believe that number is way up from $80 million. Either way, the NHL stands to gain quite the influx of cash if they can expand.\n\nThe Winnipeg Jets paid a $60 million relocation fee on top of the reported $170 million True North paid to purchase the Atlanta Thrashers. The relocation fee likely wouldn't be in the same range as an expansion fee, but it offers a more recent point of reference.\n\nTalk of widespread expansion is a big step away from what commissioner Gary Bettman told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in June:\n\n\u201cRight now, we're not looking to expand. I know Las Vegas is an important city. Whether or not it's a city for the NHL to put a team in is still to be determined. We have not done any investigating as to whether or not the city could support the NHL or looked at potential ownership groups. If the owners were to approve expansion, we would certainly begin looking more closely at Las Vegas and other potential markets.\u201d\nIt doesn't shut the door, but there's a lot of moving parts to expansion and you'll never hear the NHL commissioner get ahead of himself. It's clear that the gears are in motion on some level, though.\n\nQuebec City is already building an arena that is set to be completed by 2015. The Vegas arena will be ready by 2016. Investors have interest in putting an arena in Markham, Ont., and Hamilton, Ont., has also long been a possible expansion/relocation target.\n\nSeattle meanwhile has yet to break ground on an a new arena, but there has been some movement recently as real estate mogul Victor Coleman is adding some weight to a potential ownership group. He recently met with Chris Hansen, who is working towards bringing an NBA team to Seattle and has promised the city an arena if successful. There were reportedly talks of building the arena if the city secures an NHL team first. Coleman told KING5 News in Seattle that there is a \"clear path\" to bringing the NHL to the city.\n\nA possible 34-team league by 2017 is a bit concerning, however. Could the international talent pool support it? It seems to be a stretch. Diluting the competition should be a major fear as there are a lot of NHL players right now that are just barely scraping by in a 30-team league. You don't have to look any further than a lot of the fourth lines in the league. Thirty-two teams may even be a stretch at that point, but adding 50 new players wouldn't be as straining as trying to add 100.\n\nThere are a lot of questions left to be answered and the fact that none of the hockey insiders that are usually on top of the big stories like this have backed up the reports yet certainly takes a little air out of these exciting developments.\n\nExpecting the NHL to expand by 2017 without relocating current teams seems a bit overly-optimistic, but the league is making more money than it ever has and is enjoying growing popularity. More expansion is probably at its most likely since 2000 when the Minnesota Wild and Columbus Blue Jackets entered the league and that offers some serious excitement for some possibly hockey-hungry markets.","The son of an aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s uncle is in hiding in France after evading abduction by agents of the Communist regime, foreign diplomatic sources believe.\n\n\u201cThere was an attempt to force him to go back, but it is thought he escaped and is somewhere in France. There is an attempt to locate him but he hasn\u2019t been found yet,\u201d said the diplomatic source.\n\nThe architecture student, referred to only by his surname Han, went missing last month, raising concerns for his safety. He is believed to be the son of a close confidant of Jang Song-thaek, Kim Jon-un\u2019s once powerful uncle who was executed in December last year on treason charges. Han's father is known to have been killed recently as part of a Kim regime purge of Jang allies.\n\nPark Sung-jin, Paris correspondent for Yonhap, South Korea\u2019s biggest news agency which broke the story, said: \u201cSince the 1980s, when the regime changes and someone is executed and his relatives and friends and family are studying abroad, they are brought home.\n\n\u201cIf Han returned he would likely be kept in a political prison or executed. That has happened many times. He knew what was awaiting him, so he escaped.\u201d\n\nHan\u2019s curious disappearance, which comes amid heightened tensions between North Korea and America over the Sony Entertainment Pictures hacking scandal, has lifted the lid on the murky ties France keeps with the Communist regime.\n\nDespite having no official diplomatic relations with the dictatorship, France has been behind a discreet student programme in place since 2002 in which North Korean students from privileged backgrounds study architecture in Paris. The stated aim is for them to return to Pyongyang and launch grandiose architectural projects to the glory of the dictatorship.\n\nHan was studying at Paris\u2019 prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette. He had left North Korea for Paris in 2012, along with nine other North Koreans, five of whom are posted at another architecture school in Belleville. They are in their third year of a five-year course.\n\n\"We didn\u2019t decide out of the blue to take on students from North Korea, the decision was made by the French culture ministry to whom we answer. This is over our heads,\u201d said a head teacher at the La Villette school, who recalled her surprise when the first batch of students turned up wearing badges with the effigy of their \u201cDear Leader\u201d.\n\nThe students are kept under close surveillance, she told The Telegraph.\n\n\u201cThere is often an Asian man in a three-piece suit waiting in the courtyard, checking up on attendance and if they get good results,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen one failed part of his exam and was sent home, a representative from the North Korean delegation in Paris wanted to take it in his place. We had to explain that wasn\u2019t possible,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter long denying its existence, the French foreign ministry confirmed to The Telegraph that a \u201ccooperation programme\u201d involving \u201cstudents from North Korea trained in architecture in Paris\u201d has been in place for the past decade.\n\nIt had no further comment.\n\nThe programme was set up by Jean-No\u00ebl Juttet, a former French ambassador to Japan, who said he was asked by the French foreign ministry to find ways of \u201cmaintaining contact between the two countries\u201d.\n\nHoming in on education, he said the French suggested courses in \u201cpriority sectors, like medicine, food or construction\u201d but that the North Koreans were only interested in one field: architecture.\n\n\u201cThat was a request that came all the way from the top. They insisted so much that we ended up agreeing,\u201d he told Street Press, an online news site that first uncovered the student programme.\n\nTrained in France, the land of star architects like Jean Nouvel, the students are supposed to help transform Pyongyang\u2019s skyline with new, cutting-edge architectural designs, such as the Ryugyong hotel, a 330-metre high edifice completed in 2012. They have reportedly been behind designs for a new ice skating rink, dolphinarium and sports centre opened last year to help North Korea become a \u201cnew society of leisure\u201d.\n\nArchitecture is not Kim Jong-un\u2019s only area of interest in France. In April, it also emerged that the Emmental-loving despot had ordered three officials to attend a crash course in cheese-making at a dairy school in eastern France - reportedly because he was dissatisfied with his country\u2019s attempts at dairy production. The school politely declined.\n\nFrance has historically kept relatively warm ties with Communist nations, including China. In 2011, it emerged that a French neurosurgeon, Francois-Xavier Roux, had secretly treated Kim Jong-il, the former North Korean leader, in 2008 after he had a stroke.\n\nDescribing Kim as apparently \"profoundly Francophile\u201d, Dr Roux said: \"He wanted to establish political ties with France. He was not hiding that.\n\n\"He also knew French cinema very well. I was pretty surprised. He knew French wines pretty well. We were talking about the differences between Bourgogne and Bordeaux, etc.\"\n\nLast month, it was reported that Pyongyang flew in a French surgeon to operate on Kim Jong-un\u2019s feet after state media pictured him walking with a cane.\n\nBehind the university exchange lies a complex game of parallel diplomacy, according to North Korea expert Pierre Rigoulot.\n\n\u201cFor North Korea, the exchanges are a way of legitimising the Pyongyang regime and receiving recognition. The aim for which they will sacrifice anything is to open an embassy in Paris. It would be a small victory for the country,\u201d he told Street Press.\n\nAs for France, he said it was a way of keeping channels of communication open: \u201cYou can\u2019t send information to North Korea, so welcoming these young students is a rare opportunity to communicate with the country. In the long term, it could be a way of moving things forward.\u201d\n\nAn abduction attempt, however, if confirmed, would \u201cdefinitively scupper any North Korean request for diplomatic recognition from France,\" he said.","Two locations in Ohio and West Virginia serve the item you thought was extinct\n\nMillennial diners, want to sink your teeth into a round cheezy slab of \u201990s nostalgia?

In the same month Sony Corp (6758.T) said it had sold more than 7 million PlayStation 4 units as of April 6 and was struggling to keep up with consumer demand.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment.","Once thought to be a key component of Apple's acquisition of Beats, the Beats Music subscription service and accompanying brand will apparently be shuttered, leaving just iTunes-related software services, according to a new report.\n\nCiting five sources at Apple and Beats, TechCrunch reported on Monday that although the exact timetable is unknown, Apple plans to sunset the Beats Music service and brand. People involved in the product are said to have already been moved onto other projects at the company, including iTunes.\n\nIf true, the move would be a change from May, when Apple emphasized Beats Music as a key component of its $3 billion purchase of the headphone maker. The Beats Music product received top billing over Beats Electronics in Apple's press release announcing the deal, even though the headphone making side of the business is the brand's most recognizable role.\n\nObservers also believed that the Beats Music service allowed Apple to enter a key subscription market where the iTunes Store and iTunes Radio do not compete. Sales of digital albums have been declining in recent years as customers have migrated to competing services like Spotify and Pandora.\n\nBut Beats Music also got off to a slow start, with just 110,000 subscribers as of March. Its performance since being acquired by Apple remains unknown.\n\nThe rumor would suggest that Apple's $3 billion buyout of Beats was really about the headphones side of the business, as well as the talent and credibility brought on by the \"acqui-hires\" of Beats's Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.\n\nIovine is a longtime music industry executive and was a personal friend of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Both he and Dr. Dre have considerable sway in the industry and could help secure content for Apple's iTunes business.\n\nWhen it was announced earlier this year, Apple's $3 billion buyout of Beats proved controversial, with critics suggesting that the iPhone maker had overpaid for a company better known for its brand than quality products. But proponents believe the addition of Beats products to Apple's portfolio will help the company earn revenue from a lucrative accessories market where the company did not previously compete.\n\nUpdate: In a statement to Re/code, Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said the TechCrunch rumor is \"not true,\" but did not offer further comment on the matter. The publication cites sources at Apple as saying branding for Beats Music could change in the future, though the streaming service itself will remain active.","ISIL has released a second video allegedly showing the beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff, according to SITE Intelligence Group.\n\nThe terrorist group had previously claimed Sotloff would be killed if the U.S. continued to attack in Iraq in a video released Aug. 19. That threat came in the same video where journalist James Foley was executed by the same group. The new video allegedly also threatens David Cawthorne Haines, a British hostage.\n\nThe Wire spoke with Joe Cleffie of SITE to gather more information about the video, which the group found on \"one of the jihadi forums.\"\n\n\"We wouldn't send it out without verifying it,\" Cleffie offered. \"It's him being beheaded.\"\n\nSITE has transcribed the video on its website. In the video, Sotloff says he is \"paying the price\" for U.S. intervention in Iraq, while the same masked fighter who appeared in the video of Foley stands behind him and states the following:\n\nI'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State, because of your insistence on continuing your bombings and [unclear] on Mosul Dam, despite our serious warnings. You, Obama, have but to gain from your actions but another American citizen. So just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people...\n\nWe take this opportunity to warn those governments that enter this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State to back off and leave our people alone.\n\nBelow is a transcript of Sotloff's statement in the video:\n\nI am Steven Joel Sotloff. I'm sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing before you. And now this time for my message:\n\nObama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for the preservation of American lives and interests, so why is it that I am paying the price of your interference with my life. Am I not an American citizen? You've spent billions of U.S. tax payers dollars and we've lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the Islamic State, so where is the people's interest in reigniting this war?\n\nFrom what little I know about foreign policy, I remember a time you could not win an election without promising to bring our troops back home from Iraq and Afghanistan and to close down Guantanamo. Here you are now, Obama, nearing the end of your term, and having achieving none of the above, and deceivingly marching us the American people in the blazing fire.\n\nSotloff had disappeared while reporting in Syria in August 2013. Following his appearance in the video of Foley's beheading, Sotloff's mother, Shirley, issued a video plea to ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi asking for her son's return.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said during his daily briefing Tuesday he had not seen the video or the reports of Sotloff's death.\n\nHe noted the U.S. military effort to rescue Sotloff and Foley in July, which failed when the hostages were not at the location they targeted.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers first and foremost are with Mr. Sotloff and his family,\" Earnest said. He added that he was \"not in a position to confirm the authenticity\" of the latest video.\n\nAny new video, he said, would be \"analyzed very carefully by the U.S. government and its intelligence officials to determine its authenticity.\"\n\nAccording to BBC, British Prime Minister David Cameron has also condemned the video:\n\n\nJust before 2 p.m., The Wire received the video showing which reportedly shows the assassination of Steven Sotloff. Please note this description of the video is graphic.\n\nThe video, which is extremely graphic in nature, was edited in a manner similar to the beheading video of James Foley. The beginning of the video shows President Obama speaking in regards to ISIL and airstrikes several weeks ago. In the next scene, Sotloff introduces himself. Sotloff appears with similarly short hair as Foley did in his video, and with a beard. He is in a similar desert area, wearing the same orange robe as Foley. The area in which this is filmed is extremely windy, unlike Foley's environment during the beheading video.\n\nAfter Sotloff's brief statement, the executioner speaks and is shown putting the knife to Sotloff's neck. However, just like the Foley video, the murder scene is edited. The video shows only the knife being held up and then the decapitated body, positioned in the same manner as Sotloff's. Once again, a very short dagger, rather than a long blade, is used. The blade may be the same as in the first video. This differs greatly from traditional ISIL execution videos which have circulated the web.\n\nThe end of the video shows a  British man, David Cawthrone Haines. The executioner briefly stands next to Haines, grabbing his shirt (another long, orange robe like that of Sotloff and Foley) before releasing him and stepping to the side. The video then turns black and white, quite blurry, before ending. The executioner does not hold a knife when showing Haines, and there may be a slight murmur of background noise from others before the video ends.\n\nOf particular note are three major edits: the black screens introducing each part of the video, the editing out of Sotloff's executioner, and the executioner's voice. The voice sounds as though it may have been manipulated after the video was shot. While the man in the video appears similar to Foley's executioner, he sounds slightly deeper and more computerized. In the first video, the voice is being used to identify the executioner, and this may be the reason for the change in this second video.\n\nThis story is developing.","In Q1 2015, we expect that Apple could very well release at least two new products \u2013 the Apple Watch and the 12-inch MacBook Air. We have heard two separate rumors that the former will be launched in March and the latter will see a general Q1 2015 release, but if you\u2019re still a little skeptical, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has basically \u201cconfirmed\u201d it.\nKuo has been known for his pretty accurate predictions regarding Apple\u2019s product lineup and their release timeframes, so there could be some truth in his claims. According to Kuo, he confirms that Apple will indeed be releasing the Apple Watch in March and the upcoming 12-inch MacBook Air later on in the quarter as well, but no specific dates were provided.\nAccording to Kuo, the Apple Watch could see some supply constraint. This is due to key components of the wearable having low production yields, but Kuo notes that this is not an issue for the other components which should see high shipments in this quarter. He also expects that Apple will ship 2.5 million Apple Watch units in Q1 2015 alone.\nKuo also predicts that Apple will reveal more details about the Apple Watch ahead of its release and offer up more detailed information about its battery life and when pre-orders will begin, which we guess sounds pretty probable. However as is the case with all rumors, they\u2019re best taken with a grain of salt for now, but do check back with us in the coming weeks/months where hopefully we will have more details for you.","Seems like the President of Argentina Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez Kirchner did not exactly save a Jewish boy from becoming a werewolf. Apparently this is what happens when a tradition and an urban legend get intertwined. The tradition does dictate that the seventh child born to an Argentine family with six consecutive children of the same sex is eligible to become the godchild of the president; and the urban myth says this child\u2019s fate is unlucky as it is meant to become a werewolf sooner or later. So technically Lair Tawil was safe.\n\nAccording to the real legend of the \u2018lobiz\u00f3n\u2019 (or werewolf) it is only the seventh son of the seventh son who could be potentially cursed. The Guardian reported Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda said, \u201cThe local myth of the \u2018lobiz\u00f3n\u2019 is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president.\u201d\n\nThe tradition of the president adopting a seventh child began in 1907 when then-president Jos\u00e9 Figueroa Alcorta, was asked by Russian immigrants Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann to become their son\u2019s godfather. \u201cThe couple wanted to maintain a custom from Czarist Russia, where the Tsar was said to become godfather to seventh sons, and Argentina\u2019s president accepted.\u201d\n\nAlthough Isabel Per\u00f3n passed the law in 1974, it\u2019s still so that not every seventh child is eligible to become a presidential godchild; the honor is only given to those in which seven sons are born consecutively, with no daughters in between. The president with most godsons was Juan Per\u00f3n, who had 1,982 over three terms in office. Kirchner has already become the presidential godmother of almost 700 children since taking office in 2007, and for all we know, she might've saved a few from becoming werewolves.","Like most other places with people, Lima, Peru has a surplus of men who pass those crucial moments throughout their work day by sexually harassing women in the streets.\n\nEverlast, the brand you had no clue was this fierce, actually did something about it.\n\nThey filmed men catcalling their own mothers. Everlast tracked down the mothers of their very scummy spawn and got them on board for a worthwhile mission: shame your son by getting him to accidentally catcall you. Everlast gave these moms makeovers, wigs, manicures, the whole thing. Then they sent these women out all dressed up like all the other desperate women who wear dresses out in public so that they could be magnets for pervy lines like \u201cwhere are you going, can I come?\u201d\n\nPredictably, this video shows the sons saying dirty stuff to their own mothers in disguise, but it doesn\u2019t stop there. In the typically charming way we\u2019re all so enchanted with, one dude calls his own mom \u201cpiggy.\u201d Another says, \u201ctasty panties!\u201d That\u2019s when the most satisfying part happens. The mothers turn around for the reveal and bitch these men out. So this is one chance encounter with a lady in the street they won\u2019t forget. The glorious leader of this effort, who is wearing fingerless Everlast driving gloves, wants the moms to slap these scoundrels, but watching them freak out is even more gratifying. Even if it isn\u2019t real, it\u2019s required viewing for all men with female relatives.\n\nIt could have been trite to have moms help their sons see the light by subjecting them to street harassment. It might have been corny if Everlast gave these dudes a chance to redeem themselves. But these boss women offered no such opportunity. They were on a war path to make their sons pay. In one screaming session, they express all the anger you\u2019ve felt every time you had to deal with sex invites in the morning.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty genius way to turn the tables on the catcallers. At least it\u2019s definitely more effective than issuing a friendly card explaining why it\u2019s not polite to express interest in a stranger\u2019s underwear. One of the guy\u2019s explains to his mommy that it wasn\u2019t him saying those nasty things. (It was the guy in the car.) Iron-clad alibis like this are best handled by a raging mother in heels. Freud may have already died, but now he\u2019s literally dying over this.\n\nWatch this glorious victory with the English translation below.\n\n\n\n[Reddit]","Masked Isis executioner Jihadi John has been injured in US led airstrikes, it has been reported.\n\nThe unidentified Briton, who savagely beheaded two British and two American hostages held captive by Islamic State, is believed to have narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit in Al Qaim, in Anbar Province, Western Iraq, an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border, last Saturday (8 November).\n\nAmerican and Iraqi jets targeted the meeting of around 30 of the militant group's leaders, held in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them.\u201d- The Foreign Office\n\nThe joint US-Iraqi mission left at least ten IS commanders dead, and around 40 injured.\n\nIt was originally thought that IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was killed in the attack, however audio recordings emerged later confirming he survived.

We cannot confirm these reports.\"\n\nA spokesman for US Central Command said they are also unable to confirm the details for security reasons.\n\nThe executioner, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, was reportedly rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment. According to source, a nurse who treated the wounded in a hospital in Deir-ez-Zour, confirmed that one of the names on the injured list was Jalman, commenting that it was \"the one who slaughtered the journalists.\"\n\nThe extent of his injuries is not yet known, but a source said that urgent calls were made through the local mosque's loudspeakers, appealing for the town's residents to donate blood at the hospital.\n\nAfter being treated at the hospital, Jihadi John, Al-Baghdadi and several other wounded IS personnel were then driven to Syria, and travelled 200 miles north along the Euphrates valley to the IS stronghold of Raqqa.\n\nThey were transferred to two captured Syrian army barracks and treated within the secure confines of the underground medical facilities. Hospitals in Raqqa and nearby Deir-ez-Zour were ordered to take their medical supplies and staff to the secure bases, for the treatment of the injured terrorist leaders.\n\nJihadi John was videoed beheading British aid workers David Haines, 44, from Perth, and Alan Henning, 47, from Manchester; and American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31.\n\nIn the most recent execution video of Mr Henning, released last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker.\n\nIn September, FBI Director James Comey confirmed the American bureau had identified the foreign jihadist after weeks of transatlantic intelligence efforts, but would not be releasing his identity.\n\nA western Muslim recruit with a British accent, Jihadi John is one of the most hunted terrorists in the world, and is said to have acquired a position of seniority within the terror group for his allegiance to them. He has been made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS 'wilayat', or province.\n\nWhile British converts are usually used as foot soldiers, Jihadi John usually travels in a black Audi jeep, and has six other British terrorists with him who serve as his bodyguards.\n\nAged between 28 and 31, he was named as Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a rapper from Maida Vale, west London. Fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, he first joined IS in Iraq when he left the UK, but then moved to Syria.\n\nIn September, his father, Adel Abdul Bary, 54, pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in relation to al-Qaida's bombing on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.\n\nRelatedIs Isis Executioner 'Jihadi John' an Anonymous Hacktivist?Steven Sotloff Beheading: 'Justice Will Be Served' Obama Warns IsisSteven Sotloff: Video Appears to Show Isis Beheading of US JournalistTributes Pour in for US Journalist Beheaded by Jihadist with 'British Accent'Isis Release Horrific Video Showing Apparent Beheading of US journalist James Wright FoleyDavid Haines' Isis Executioner 'Was On Drugs' During Beheading, Says Voice ExpertSteven Sotloff Beheading: Cameron Calls Cobra Meeting as Isis Threaten to Execute British Captive","A Russian fisherman says the only thing that prevented a brown bear from killing him was Justin Bieber\u2014specifically, a ringtone of Bieber's first big hit, \"Baby.\"\n\nIgor Vorozhbitsyn, 42, had parked his car and started walking toward the fishing spot he'd marked out for that day when the bear jumped him from behind.\n\n\"There was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me,\" he said, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nThe bear mauled Vorozhbitsyn's face and chest, inflicting serious cuts and bruises.

That procedure, intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, involved the insertion of a camera down her throat.\n\nAfter Cohen, the clinic's medical director, finished his work, a biopsy was done on Rivers without her prior consent, according to the source.\n\nAn ear, nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic as required by law performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. The doctor is described by the source as Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat physician.\n\nClinic: Vocal-cord biopsy did not kill Joan Rivers\n\n\"Even though you are a licensed physician, you still should have, if you will, the checks and balances to get your approval to practice in that particular place,\" said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University's Langone Medical Center.\n\nInvestigators believe that Rivers' vocal chords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29, the source said.\n\nRivers, 81, was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she died a week later.\n\nYorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released.\n\nThe day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Dr. Cohen \"is not currently performing procedures...nor is he currently serving as medical director.\"\n\nThe source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators.\n\nThe clinic declined to respond to the source's comments about a biopsy or a selfie, citing federal privacy law.","Johannesburg - Dog fighters forced children as young as 9 to imitate real dog fights, placing bets on which child will cause the most injury through biting and scratching.\n\nThe horrific form of abuse, which shows just how damaging dog fighting can be to children, came to light early last year in Ekurhuleni, but not much has been done to help the children involved.\n\nInspector Wendy Willson, from the special investigations unit at the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA), was called to a school in Springs in June to see if they could do something about the problem there.\n\nWillson said the school principal, who will not be named to protect the identity of the children, was concerned that pupils were returning from breaktime with torn clothing and injuries.\n\nTeachers then discovered the children were fighting each other in dog fighting role-play, while other pupils were placing bets on who would win.\n\nThe children were doing this because adults were encouraging them at weekends to take part, both in actual dog fighting and the role-play fighting.\n\nIOL  st DOGfighting 3\nSUPPLIED\nWillson witnessed the children getting down on all fours \u2013 barking, growling, biting and scratching each other.\n\n\u201cThey rip into each other. The play is aggressive enough to cause each other injury,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a video of one fight, which was much tamer than what was really happening because the children were asked to provide an example, the imitation of dogs is so authentic that if you close your eyes and listen, you will think you are listening to real dogs.\n\nThe children who were bystanders were acting out the role of dog handlers and were betting R2 to R10 on the fights that were taking place.\n\n\u201cThe winner of the fight then gets to mate with a younger child as a reward.\u201d\n\nWillson was not sure if the mimicry moved on to actual copulation. She said this was in imitation of the best fighting dogs who get to be stud animals and mate with female dogs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly disturbing that young children are being forced to be involved in this,\u201d Willson said.\n\nShe added that the children had told her that in order to stop being a \u201cfemale dog\u201d, you have to bring in a younger child to take your place.\n\nWillson said the NSPCA had discovered, just as they had seen in other areas in which dog fighting had taken hold, that violent crime was increasing.\n\nThe NSPCA removed dogs that were involved in fighting. It also discovered cases of bestiality and other instances of horrific animal cruelty, and removed the animals from the situation.\n\nWillson said the perpetrators involve children in the theft of the dogs, the training and in the actual fights. The children were rewarded either with money or dog food for their own dogs, which were used in fights.\n\nShe said the older the child, the less empathetic he or she was. One child had told her: \u201cIt makes me feel like laughing. It makes me feel powerful\u201d.\n\nThe inspector said they had recorded elevated levels of aggression, bullying and theft in the children. There had been attacks on teachers, causing injuries.\n\n\u201cI have never seen this before,\u201d Willson added. \u201cI searched for examples of children being used like this internationally and came up with nothing.\u201d\n\nThe Gauteng Department of Education said it had been made aware of these allegations early last year. \u201cThe department had contacted the SPCA to request their intervention,\u201d said spokeswoman Phumla Sekhonyane.\n\nWillson said the NSPCA had conducted two awareness-raising workshops at the Springs school and the local police station, involving members of the community, principals, police, the Justice Department and child protection services, but while everyone had raised concern, nothing significant had been done to help the children.\n\nA director of IRS Forensic Investigations, Glenda Paul, said the matter was of grave concern. \u201cIt is bad enough that criminals are gambling on animals tearing themselves apart for their sick pleasure, but to involve children is pure evil.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are like cogs in a machine\u201d\n\nTeddy Bear Clinic director Shaheda Omar said it was the first time she had ever heard of the dog-fighting role-play taking place.\n\n\u201cI have seen cases where children violate animals and show no remorse, but never this,\u201d Omar said. She said it sounded to her like a situation in which children had unmet emotional needs and they needed to find ways to be in a powerful position.\n\n\u201cThese children are being used. They are like cogs in a machine. I\u2019m sure some sort of reward is offered and they are being socialised into that behaviour,\u201d Omar said.\n\n\u201cViolence begets violence and the children are learning it from adults.\u201d\n\nThe situation needed urgent, systemic intervention, and different departments needed to get involved to stop the abuse and the children\u2019s behaviour, she said.\n\n\u201cIf nothing is done, this will become a breeding ground for sociopaths,\u201d Omar said.\n\nDirty secret breeding organised crime\n\nDog fighting is defined as a sadistic contest in which two dogs, which have been specifically bred and trained to fight, are placed in a small arena to fight each other for the entertainment of spectators and for gambling purposes. It is violent organised crime that is often linked to other criminal activities.\n\nThere are three broad categories of dog fighting:\n\n* Street-level dog fighting, which is usually linked to gang activities and during which people boast about their dog\u2019s strength and fighting ability.\n\n* Dog fighting as a hobby involves people buying dogs of average ability and entering them in local and regional matches.\n\n* Professional dog fighting is the most sophisticated of the three and is sometimes conducted at national and international levels. High-stake matches featuring experienced fighting dogs with established bloodlines take place.\n\nMany children in high-crime areas and informal settlementsare exposed to dog fighting intheir neighbourhoods, and this routine exposure to unfettered animal abuse and neglect is a major contributing factor in their later manifestation of social deviance.\n\nIt is well documented that by exposing children to such cruel brutality and repeated violence, they become desensitised and tend to perpetuate the cycle of violence, as well as promoting insensitivity towards animal suffering, an enthusiasm for violence and disrespect for the law. - Source: SPCA brochure entitled Dogfighting \u2013 SA\u2019s dirty little secret\n\nangelique.serrao@inl.co.za","Our 2015 calendars are about to turn over to February and there's still no confirmed launched date for the Apple Watch. As a result, speculation on when the touchscreen wearable will hit shelves is beginning to reach a fervor. Fear not, however, as Ming-Chi Kuo, the analyst with a mostly reliable track record, is here to contribute to the prediction that the Apple Watch will begin shipping in March. Even more, Kuo says the much-discussed 12-inch MacBook Air will launch before the end of 2015's first quarter.\n\nAs an analyst for KGI Securities, Kuo's latest report says that before the Apple Watch's official release, Apple may announce additional details about the device (that's a big \"no duh\"), including battery life specifics and when pre-orders will begin. He predicts that while components for the Apple Watch will see high shipments throughout the first quarter, initial production numbers will be low and a high customer demand will make the product hard to find. Kuo forecasts there will be 2.8 million Apple Watch shipments during the first quarter of 2015.\n\nAs for the new 12-inch MacBook Air, the analyst says the ultra-thin laptop will make its debut before the end of the current quarter, with additional information saying that Quanta Computer, an Apple supplier, has already begun increasing production. As a brand new entry to the MacBook Air line, the 12-inch model has long been suggested to feature a Retina display and an even thinner design, while recent rumors have pegged the notebook to ship with only a headphone jack and a single new reversible USB Type-C connector that will be used for charging.\n\nA release date for the new MacBook Air within the current quarter definitely seems soon, but an alleged leak of the laptop's display only days ago could back up Kuo's claim of production having already begun. As for his prediction of a March release for the Apple Watch, that seems like a pretty safe bet, since Apple's own website says the device is \"coming early 2015.\" We'll just have to wait to see if the wearable actually ships that month, of if that's just when pre-orders will begin.\n\nSOURCE MacRumors","Spokesman for Palestinian President Abbas,Tayeb Abdel Rahim, claimed that al-Sisi had not made an offer to extend the Gaza Strip, but that his predecessor Morsi had made such an offer to Abbas.","A source familiar with the matter, has told Benzinga that China's Lenovo Group Limited (OTC: LNVGY) could make an offer to acquire Canadian mobile communications company, BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ: BBRY), as early as this week.\n\nThe source said Lenovo's first offer would be $15.00 per share, with a deal ultimately getting done around $18.00 per share.\n\nLenovo's CFO Wong Wai Ming said in January 2013, that BlackBerry (still known as Research in Motion at that time) was one of many possible opportunities for the company.

They arrived at Camp Edwards on Sept. 11 and were last seen Saturday at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis during an off day for the program.\n\nThe soldiers were reported missing by base security personnel Saturday night. They were identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar.\n\nIt's not unusual for foreign military members to go missing when they are in the U.S. for training missions. Earlier this month, two Afghan police taking part in a training mission at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia disappeared. They were later found in Georgetown.\n\nOn Monday, Army Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said the 14 Afghans taking part in the Cape Cod military exercise were \"thoroughly vetted\" prior to coming to the U.S., so officials do not believe they are a threat.\n\nThe Regional Cooperation training exercises have been held annually since 2004 to promote cooperation and interoperability among forces, build functional capacity, practice peacekeeping operations and enhance readiness.\n\nThis year's exercise, which involves more than 200 participants from six nations including the U.S., is scheduled to wrap up Wednesday.

The largest crabs in the world are thought to be Japanese spider crabs - also known as Macrocheira kaempferi - which can grow to the size of a small car with an impressive leg span of up to twelve feet. However, these crabs live in deep, cold water around Japan and are a completely different shape.\n\n2. Another huge crab with a more similar shape to the one in the picture is the Tasmanian giant crab, also known as Pseudocarcinus gigas. These are the world's heaviest crabs but they reside in the southern waters of Australia at depths of 20-820 metres.\n\n3. Mr Clark did not think that the crab was a representation of Cancer pagurus, also known as the edible crab, either because of a slightly different shape. And anyway, these tend to only grow to a maximum of 30 centimetres.\n\n4. Instead, he said that the crab looked more to him like a shore crab (Carcinus maenas) - cleverly Photoshopped on to a satellite image. \"A hoax is an understatement. A shore crab gets up to two inches - if you're lucky!\" he said.\n\n5. Internet hoax debunkers have also been on the case, with a user from ThatsNonsense.com pointing out that the the image of the harbour was taken from Bing maps, sans crustacean in the original satellite photograph, of course.","In a recent thread on Reddit, one Apple customer describes an experience in which he effected change in Apple's daily operations, specifically as it pertains to \"on hold\" music, after contacting CEO Tim Cook via email.\n\nSince the days of Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executives have been famously open to customer suggestions, complaints and praise, often engaging with the public via work email accounts.

It was super low quality, therefore an upbeat rock song sounded like pure distortion and really aggravated me because I was on hold for 20+ minutes for something so simple (iPhone didn't turn on, needed to set up a repair as in my country no Apple Store = have to send it to another country).\n\nMuch to my surprise a lady from Cupertino called me up the next day, saying she'd received a concerning email from Tim about ugly distortion hold music while on the phone, that Tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done. She assured me that the hold music would be tested to make sure it sounded pleasant on all types of phones and connections.\n\nThe next time I called Apple, the hold music was indeed very pleasant.\n\nCook is known to be just as open to criticism . During an interview with NBC's Brian Williams in 2012, Cook admitted he routinely receives hundreds of emails from customers every day.\n\n\"I get hundreds, and some days thousands of emails from customers.

In the 19th century, parents were reportedly so spooked by \"el lobizon\" that they started abandoning and murdering their 7th children.\n\nAround the same time, in the early 20th century, another tradition involving a seventh child came to be.

Reportedly, the godchild custom goes back all the way to 1907 when Russian emigr\u00e9s asked the then-president Jos\u00e9 Figueroa Alcorta to become the godfather to their seventh son, reports the Guardian.\n\n\"The local myth of the lobiz\u00f3n is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,\" Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda told The Guardian.\n\nSo what exactly what special about Iair Tawil's case? Traditionally, the seventh son or daughter could only become a godchild of the Argentinian president if he or she was Christian. But Tawil was the first Jewish young man to do so \u2014 making it a tweet-worthy affair.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez has become the president godmother to roughly 700 children since she took office in 2007, reports The Guardian.\n\nNo word on how many children she has saved from becoming werewolves.","The woman was reportedly furious she had not been told of his condition\n\nAn Indian bride has reportedly swapped her groom for a wedding guest mid-ceremony after her fianc\u00e9 had an epileptic seizure.\n\nJugal Kishore, 25, reportedly fell to the ground during the traditional exchange of \u201cvarmala\u201d flower garlands in the northern town of Rampur.\n\nHis illness was a shock to his wife-to-be, 23-year-old Indira, who was apparently furious that she and her family had not been told of Mr Kishore\u2019s epilepsy.\n\nInstead of calling the wedding off, she quickly chose wedding guest Harpal Singh, her sister\u2019s brother-in-law, to replace him.\n\nCasually dressed in jeans and a leather jacket, he accepted, the Times of India reported.\n\nAfter the swap, the wedding ceremony continued as planned until Mr Kishore returned from hospital.\n\nShocked at returning to his own wedding to find his fianc\u00e9e celebrating her marriage to someone else, he and his relatives reportedly pleaded with Indira to reverse her decision.\n\nWhen diplomacy failed, the family allegedly resorted to violence and entered into a brawl involving plates and cutlery.\n\nMr Kishore\u2019s family later filed a complaint at the local Milak police station but withdrew it after older relatives intervened.\n\nRP Solanki, an official at the station, told the Times of India two wedding guests were briefly arrested.\n\n\u201cBoth families have amicably resolved the matter,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe complaints have been withdrawn.

Moreover, the gadget with high focus on fashion will be offered in six different casing options. In addition, the smartwatch's band can reportedly be interchanged as required.

Argentina\u2019s President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner has not become godmother of a Jewish baby to stop him from becoming a werewolf \u2013 despite what you may have read in multiple news reports.\n\nOver the past few days, the story has been reported and unquestioningly re-reported across the echo chamber of the internet, picked up by news organisations around the world including Haaretz, Buzzfeed, The Independent and The Huffington Post.\n\nLike all good urban myths, the articles were based on a grain of truth: by tradition, the seventh son (or daughter) born to an Argentine family is eligible to become the godson (or daughter) of the president. Until this month, the honour had only been bestowed on Christian babies, but on Wednesday, Iair Tawil \u2013 not a baby, but the strapping 21-year old son of a rabbi \u2013 became the country\u2019s first Jewish presidential godson.\n\nIn her Twitter account, Kirchner described Tawil, 21, as \u201ccompletely sweet\u201d and lit Hanukkah candles with his family.\n\nTen\u00eda raz\u00f3n.

El pap\u00e1, dec\u00eda que no era una casualidad\u2026 pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew\n\nBut somehow, the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobiz\u00f3n (Argentina\u2019s equivalent to the European werewolf). According to some versions of the myth, the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse.\n\nEvidently, the chance meeting of a Latin American president with a colourful myth too good to fact-check proved irresistible \u2013 confirming as it did any number of stereotypes about erratic behaviour from national leaders in the continent of magical realism.\n\nBut according to Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda, there is no link between the two traditions. \u201cThe local myth of the lobiz\u00f3n is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,\u201d he said.\n\nThat custom began in 1907, when Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann, Volga German emigr\u00e9s from south-eastern Russia asked then-president Jos\u00e9 Figueroa Alcorta to become godfather to their seventh son, said the historian.\n\n\u201cThe couple wanted to maintain a custom from Czarist Russia, where the Tsar was said to become godfather to seventh sons, and Argentina\u2019s president accepted.\u201d\n\nThe practice soon became tradition and was passed into law in 1974 by Isabel Per\u00f3n, the widow of Argentina\u2019s political strongman General Juan Per\u00f3n, once she succeeded him in the presidential seat after his death in office. As Argentina\u2019s first woman president, Mrs Per\u00f3n extended the benefit to seventh daughters as well.\u201cThe unconnected myth of the lobiz\u00f3n began among Argentina\u2019s \u201cgauchos,\u201d the cowboys of Argentina\u2019s vast cattle-raising Pampas, adapted from the older European werewolf legends,\u201d said Balmaceda.In the Argentinian version, the lobiz\u00f3n transforms into a mixture of pig and dog every Tuesday and Friday night \u2013 not just once every full moon. Unlikely other werewolves of myth, the lobiz\u00f3n transmits its curse not through its bite but by passing between the legs of its unfortunate victims.\n\nIn Catholic Argentina, large familes are not uncommon: over 120,000 families had seven of more children at last count in 2006. Not all qualify to become presidential god-children as the honour is only given to those in which seven sons are born consecutively, with no daughters in between.\n\nThe president with most godsons was Juan Per\u00f3n, who had 1,982 over three terms in office. He is followed by another Peronist former president, Carlos Menem, who had 1,136 during the 1990s. Fern\u00e1ndez has become presidential godmother to some 700 children since taking office in 2007. Earlier this year, she set another precedent, by making the the daughter of a lesbian couple the first presidential godchild.","The giant Samauma tree that is thought to be over 5,800 years old judging on its concentric rings and estimated to be close to 40 meters in height was a major part of the native tribes cultural landscape, countless generations of natives having witnessed the long duration of the tree and having included it in their own culture.\n\n\u00abIt is the Mother spirit of the rainforest, from this spirit-tree came the life force of all things living.

She might be more than that, though: their license has lapsed without a wedding, and one journalist claims it's because Manson got wise to Star's alleged plan to acquire his corpse and put it on public display for money. Holy shit, really? Here's what we know.\n\nDaniel Simone, who's working on a book about Manson, told Page Six that Star Burton and her associate, Craig \"Gray Wolf\" Hammond, have been scheming for two years to open a Lenin's Tomb-style attraction in California, with the madman's body on view in a glass case.\n\nWhen the two asked Manson to sign his body over to them, Simone says, he wouldn't give a definitive answer. He just led them on so they'd keep bringing him \"toiletries and other items\" in prison. The marriage plot was the next step, according to Simone, an attempt to ensure Star would get Manson's remains after his death.\n\n\"There's certain things next of kin can do,\" she told the AP last November, saying she wanted to work on Manson's case and the marriage would give her access to confidential information. She didn't mention the body.\n\nAnd now Manson has let their 90-day marriage certificate lapse.\n\n\"He's finally realized that he's been played for a fool,\" Simone claims, adding that Manson thinks Burton's plan for his body is stupid because \"he feels he will never die.\" Now Manson allegedly doesn't want to get married at all.\n\nThat's not what Burton and Hammond's website claims, though: They say Manson plans to renew the license, and the wedding was only postponed \"due to an unexpected interruption in logistics.\"\n\nBut who's playing whom, here? Back in 2013, when Burton first announced her engagement to Manson in Rolling Stone, Manson dismissed her:\n\nHe snorts. \"Oh, that,\" he says. \"That's a bunch of garbage. You know that, man. That's trash. We're just playing that for public consumption.\"\nManson also called \"Star\" his \"baby on the floor,\" implying that he was manipulating her like he did the other women in his murderous Family. Like them, she shaved her head and carved an x into her forehead at his request.\n\n\"We started all over with this one. The other ones know it all now. I don't need to say anything.\"\n\nHe doesn't come off like the one being \"played for a fool\" in that scenario. And Burton's claim that Manson thinks he can never die doesn't square with what Manson himself told Rolling Stone contributor Eric Hedegaard back in 2013: \"What do you think? Do you think this story will help me get out of here, only for a little while, before I go?\"\n\nBurton wouldn't necessarily need Manson's corpse to make money, either: His son said last year that Manson's made a six-figure fortune selling art and memorabilia, which Star would stand to inherit. He also claimed she and Grey Wolf planned to sell the wedding photos for as much as $150,000.\n\nSo, is the \"glass case\" story bullshit? Hard to say, because it's not supported by direct quotes from Burton, who wouldn't comment to Page Six, or Manson, who lost his phone privileges years ago, and whose current whereabouts and medical condition the prison system won't reveal.\n\nAnd even if they were talking, one is an unreliable, allegedly manipulative crazy person, and the other is Charles Manson.","Domino's was still killing it with the Noid in the '90s when McDonald's rolled out McPizzas to get in on \"the dinnertime business.\" The fast-food chain made clever signs by tipping Golden Arches sideways into serviceable Zs, and Pizza Hut's copywriters predicted, \"Every place you see a McDonald's pizza, you're going to see a war.\" Formidable as all that seemed, that war never came and McPizza became a nostalgic slice for countless millennials, which is why it's insane that two locations owned by a guy along the Ohio\u2013West Virginia border are still cranking out the \"pizza you won't believa.\"\n\n\n\nTwo decades ago, the chain's \"patented\" ovens needed five and a half minutes to bake pizzas \u2014 time-consuming McPizzas were the the McWraps of their day \u2014 so most were gone by 2000.

If that figure holds true, that would make it far and away the largest corporate layoff event in history, breaking the record previously held by IBM, when it cut 60,000 in 1993.\n\nFEATURED RESOURCE\n\nPresented by Jive Software\n10 Commandments of Collaboration for Exceptional Customer Service\nRead this whitepaper to discover best practices that drive brand affinity, repeat business and\nLEARN MORE\nThe report comes from long-time Silicon Valley journalist Robert X. Cringely, who recently published an eBook on IBM's issues entitled The Decline and Fall of IBM. He blamed past CEOs Louis Gerstner and Sam Palmisano for making the mess and current CEO Virginia Rometty has done nothing to address them.\n\nThe problem is a complex mess of bad management \u2013 like laying off important people in the middle of a project \u2013 to getting sidetracked with pie-in-the-sky ideas like commercializing Watson and failing to adjust to the new era. The \"M\" in IBM may mean machines, but hardware is less than 10% of its business. Two-thirds is in services, and the services pipeline has dried up.\n\nWhy? Well, according to an ex-IBMer I spoke to some time ago, who confirmed what Cringely wrote in his book, IBM is still wedded to services contracts in an age where companies are shutting down their internal data center entirely and moving everything to the cloud. If you don't have a data center, you don't need an IBM service contract to manage it.\n\n\nThat's why IBM grabbed Softlayer, the cloud services provider. It needed to get into the cloud fast because it was behind Microsoft, Google and Amazon. Since the purchase 18 months ago, IBM has put a huge amount of money into SoftLayer and there has been a number of announcements around SoftLayer services.\n\nCringely said the mainframe and storage areas will see deep cuts, which is pretty stupid considering IBM announced the new Z13 mainframe and hopes it will stimulate sales. That won't be easy when you cut the people who are supposed to sell it. Cutting storage is also foolish, as we are in the era of Big Data and Data Lakes and storage is vital to these concepts.\n\nAnd you have to wonder what a layoff of 110,000 people will do to the firm. That has to be jarring. I remember an old advertisement from the print days that said \"What's worse, getting laid off on a Friday or being told to pick up the slack on the following Monday?\" This will be undeniably upsetting to the survivors, who will likely spend time updating their LinkedIn profiles.\n\nThe question I have to ask is why isn't Rometty one of the 110k. IBM has seen 11 straight quarters of declining revenue and it's hemorrhaging customers, according to both my source and Cringely. It's becoming apparent she is not up for the job and can't pull the company out of its nose dive.\n\nCringely said the layoffs will begin next week and by the end of February, all of the employees will be gone. If nothing else, IBM's first quarter numbers will take a monstrous hit from the severance packages for 111,000 employees. To say nothing of what this will do to its customer confidence.","Last night, Pando\u2019s Michael Carney cited a well-placed source who claims that Apple is on the verge of buying flailing social network, Path.

For one thing, from a PR point of view, Morin\u2019s response was exactly right. If the deal is about to happen, then he\u2019s hardly going to confirm it on stage to a reporter ahead of time. If the deal isn\u2019t about to happen, Morin can still benefit from the idea that Path is still valuable to someone.\n\nAnd yet, it\u2019s interesting how Morin\u2019s \u201cno comment\u201d flies in the face of a promise he made to Pando\u2019s Sarah Lacy last year about how he and Path would deal with the press in future. As Sarah explained at the time:\n\nI explained the problem from the journalists\u2019 side, and asked Morin what he proposed for a publication and entrepreneurs who want to start having a fairer dialog. Not a favorable one, but a fair one. Something that helps readers more than the denial, the reporter speculation, and the rewritten press release. He said for his part he was no longer going to obfuscate anything. If a reporter gets a scoop, and it\u2019s accurate and he or she calls him up, he\u2019ll say congratulations and tell them to run with it. No more playing games.\n\nGiven Morin\u2019s response on stage today, and the fact Carney contacted him last night for comment but received no response, perhaps a more accurate promise would have been \u201cNo more playing games, unless I\u2019m scared shitless of upsetting Apple.\u201d","(Sept. 22, 2014, update 1:09 p.m.) A high-ranking source tells the Cape Cod Times that the three Afghan soldiers who were reported missing after leaving a training exercise at Camp Edwards on Cape Cod have been located at the Canadian border, apparently seeking asylum.\n\nThe source has been briefed on the issue, but could not be quoted on the record because he was not authorized to speak.\n\nU.S. Central Command could not immediately confirm the information.\n\nThe Afghan soldiers went missing Saturday at Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis.\n\nMassachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt.

It is still unclear whether the men were beheaded or crucified, since both forms of punishment are widely used by the Islamic State militants.\nAccording to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, one of the executed fighters was charged with \"banditry and robbing Muslims' money\" and the second one was accused of \"dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen,\" as cited by the Independent.\nExperts say they are not surprised by the harsh methods used by the IS, as decapitation and crucifying are common forms of punishment practiced by Sunni Wahhabi sectarians.\n\"Jihadist groups have a strict no corruption policy, meaning that while they can benefit financially from charging bank transactions and claiming a percentage of everyone\u2019s monthly income, they don\u2019t extort people like some secular groups have done in the past,\" notes Charlie Winter.\nExperts emphasize that decapitation has long been a routine practice in Saudi Arabia, a country where Islam's Sharia Law is used.\n\"According to Amnesty International at least 79 people were executed [beheaded] in Saudi Arabia in 2013 and between 1 January and 18 August this year 34 more people were executed, making a total of 113. This does not include any estimates for executions at the end of 2012,\" the Independent reported in September 2014.\nHowever, while denouncing IS's methods as gruesome and barbaric, the western policy-makers have turned a blind eye to Saudi Arabia's beheading practice.","Deir Ezzor Province: Islamic State executed two of its fighters in al- Bo kamal area in \u201cal- Forat State\u201d, where the first fighter was executed on charge of \u201cbanditry and robbing Muslims\u2019 money\u201d while the other killed on charge of \u201c dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen\u201d.\n\nAreas in the neighborhood of al Jbeleh in the city of Deir Ezzor were bombarded by the regime forces with no information about casualties so far.","Everybody, meet Bart the cat.

The giant animal is shaped like an edible crab, a species commonly found in British waters, but which only grows to be ten inches across, on average.\n\nPeople have flocked to the website Weird Whitstable since the image was first posted there, to judge its authenticity for themselves. Quinton Winter, who curates Weird Whitstable, asserted that the image of the giant crab was sent to him by a follower. At first, he believed that it showed only an unusually shaped sand formation, though he is now convinced that there truly is a strange animal lurking in the harbor.\n\nWhile crabbing with his son in Whitstable harbor last year, Winter claims to have spotted the giant crab near shore, as he related to The Daily Express.\n\nSave yourselves, Crabzilla has arrived in Whitstable http://t.co/W2NgcmJP24 pic.twitter.com/7RuUxSBUhB\n\n\u2014 Sara Nelson (@SaraCNelson) October 13, 2014\n\n\u201cAt first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, \u2018that\u2019s a funny looking bit of driftwood,\u2019 Winter said. \u201cIt had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws\u2026 Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank.

Sotloff.\n\nA masked figure in the video also issued a threat against a British hostage, a man the group named as David Haines, and warned governments to back off \"this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State\", the SITE Intelligence Group monitoring service said.\n\nSotloff, a freelance journalist, was kidnapped in Syria in August 2013. Sotloff's mother Shirley appealed on Aug. 27 in a videotaped message to Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, for her son's release.\n\nThe White House said it could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in a briefing that if there is such a video, it would be analyzed very carefully, adding that the administration's thoughts and prayers were with Sotloff's family.\n\nShortly before the briefing, the SITE monitoring service said the militant group had released the video.\n\nOn Aug. 19 the group published a video showing the beheading of U.S. hostage James Foley, a Marquette and Northwestern alum. The group said his death was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes on fighters in Iraq.\n\nThat video was issued after the United States resumed air strikes in Iraq in August for the first time since the end of the U.S. occupation in 2011.\n\nU.S. HOSTAGES\n\nlRelated U.S. military tried, but failed to rescue James Foley and other American hostages\nNATION &amp; WORLD\nU.S. military tried, but failed to rescue James Foley and other American hostages\nSEE ALL RELATED\n8\n\nAfter Islamic State's beheading of journalist James Foley, President Barack Obama's administration is making little headway in efforts to secure the release of other Americans held by the insurgent group in Syria, officials said.\n\nThe U.S. government has said it does not pay ransoms or negotiate with the Islamic State.\n\nWashington has contacted about two dozen countries for help in freeing the three, but no foreign government appears to have influence over or even significant contact with IS, which has declared an Islamic caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria.\n\n\"What we've found is that ISIS isn't responsive\" to outreach, said a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity and using an alternate acronym for the group.\n\nAnother administration official said Washington was working with other Western countries whose citizens are being held hostage, and with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and others in the region thought by the United States to possibly have influence with the groups Al-Nusrah and IS.\n\nThe hostages' fate received little public attention until Islamic State posted an online video on Aug. 19 showing Foley's beheading. It now presents a frustrating challenge for Obama.\n\nIslamic State \"is far more difficult to deal with\" than Iran or the militant group Hezbollah, which also took Americans captive, said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA and White House official now at the Brookings Institution think-tank. The group \"wants to terrorize Americans, it's not really interested in deals.\"\n\nWHITE HOUSE INVOLVEMENT\nU.S. officials and supporters of the remaining hostages requested that most details about them and efforts to free them be withheld.\n\nOne of the other U.S. hostages is a female aid worker, age 26, for whom Islamic State has demanded $6.6 million in ransom, according to ABC News.\n\nLisa Monaco, Obama's top counter-terrorism adviser, has been \"very deeply involved in this,\" the senior U.S. official said. Monaco, along with the State Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation, has been in contact with hostages' families, the official said.\n\nCaitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said, \" The Administration has had regular interactions with the families of those Americans who have been held hostage in Syria since the kidnapping of their loved ones. These interactions included representatives from all the relevant agencies, including the Department of State, the FBI, the Intelligence Community, and the White House.\"\n\nObama authorized a covert raid in Syria in July to rescue Foley and other American hostages, but they were not at the site where they were thought to be held. Another rescue attempt would be risky for U.S. special forces and the hostages.\n\nThe American diplomatic effort also is aimed at persuading European countries not to pay ransoms, officials said.\n\n\nU.S. and European officials have said that France, Spain and Italy have tolerated or facilitated ransom payments for citizens held in Syria. Islamic State released numerous European journalists this year, including two Spaniards in March and four Frenchmen in April.\n\nThe French government has denied a news report that it paid a ransom to free the four.

Pando, citing an anonymous source working in Apple's engineering team, claims that the social network may be integrated into Apple's Messages app.\n\nSo what will Apple be getting when it acquires Path? Here's a guide.\n\nOne of Path's most unique features is just how much power it gives users over who can see their posts. Users are limited to just 150 friends, with no option to share posts publicly.\n\nAs well as sharing posts to their friends, Path users can also create an \"Inner Circle\" of friends who can see their most private posts.\n\nPath is often praised for its design, with Apple even featuring the social network in keynote slides. The app includes minimalist navigation icons and clock hands that spin as you scroll through the timeline.\n\nApple's short-lived iTunes Ping service allowed users to share the music they were listening to, as well as keep track of famous musicians. Shuttered two years after its launch, the app failed to gain a significant number of users.\n\nBut a major feature of Path is very similar to Apple's Ping service. The app offers the ability to share what music you're listening to with friends.\n\nOne of Path's more unique features is the ability to share what times you go to sleep and wake up. Tap the sleep button, and Path will ask you whether you're conscious or not.\n\nSelect \"Go to Sleep\" and the app shows a night sky and a moon to get you in the mood.\n\nWhen you wake up, tap the \"Awake\" button next to the sun icon to inform all of your Path friends that you are awake.\n\nPath's latest update was the launch of a new messaging app in June. Path Talk lets you messages your Path friends, as well as share a whole load of information about yourself through the app.\n\nAs well as sensing when you're traveling on trains and in cars, the app can also continually broadcast your battery level.\n\nCurrently, Path earns money by selling virtual stickers and photo filters.\n\nThe app also sells a \"Premium\" subscription that gives you unlimited virtual stickers and photo filters.\n\nSEE ALSO:  REPORT: Apple Will Acquire Path, The Struggling Social Network","An angry woman in China tried to make sure her cheating husband would never cheat again.\n\nAccording to The Mirror, 32-year-old Fan Lung used his wife's phone to send his lover, 21-year-old Zhang Hung, a sexual message. When he forgot to log out of his account, his wife, Feng, saw the message, grabbed a pair of scissors and cut off her husband's penis when he was sleeping.\n\nFan Lung was taken to a hospital where his penis was sewn back on. However, Feng was able to sneak into the hospital, cut off her husband's penis a second time and then throw it out a window.\n\nAfter the second snip, Lung defended himself and attacked his wife.\n\nA hospital spokesman said, \"The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital. Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman.

These custom safes will be fitted with Apple Watch MagSafe chargers to ensure their safety.\n\nSet to arrive this April, the Apple Watch will offer numerous pricing options, starting at $350 and likely running into the thousands. They will come in two bezel colors: silver and gold, along with a range of different leather and sport bands.\n\nThe smartwatch itself was unveiled along with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus on September 9 last year. In addition to numerous sensors, the Apple Watch\u2019s big selling point is its \"Digital Crown,\" which allows wearers to control apps on the watch\u2019s sapphire display. Currently the devices are being tested by hundreds of Apple employees to ensure that as many bugs as possible are eliminated by launch date.\n\nApple is also getting ready to switch up the current Apple Store layout to include Apple Watch display tables, along with an area where people can try on different band materials and color options. Finally, the company is said to be investing in scales that they can use to weigh the amount of gold in Apple Watch Edition units should they be returned or replaced.\n\nWhile these security measures may strike some as extreme, Apple Stores have long been a target for break-ins\u2014with some thieves even \"ram raiding\" the heavy glass doors at the front in order to make off with thousands of dollars in tech gadgets.\n\nWith the Apple Watch being the company's biggest launch since the original iPad in 2010, it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\n[via 9to5Mac]","Islamic State has turned its hand to human organ trafficking to fund terror across the Middle East, it has been claimed.\n\nThe jihadist group has until now filled its $2million-a-year war chest from a variety of shadowy sources including oil production, human trafficking and drug smuggling.\n\nBut it was revealed today that it has been recruiting foreign doctors for months to harvest the internal organs not only from the bodies of their own dead fighters but also from living hostages - including children - snatched from minority communities in Iraq and Syria.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nLucrative: The terror organisation even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market\n\nEvil: The jihadist group has until now filled its $2million-a-year war chest through a variety of shadowy sources including oil production, human trafficking and drug smuggling.\n\nThe shocking news was revealed in a report by al-Monitor news website, citing an Iraqi ear, nose and throat doctor named Siruwan al-Mosuli.\n\nHe told the site that IS commanders have hired foreign doctors to run an extensive organ trafficking system from a hospital in the captured city of Mosul, northern Iraq, that is already beginning to generate huge profits.\n\nIt claims the terror organisation has even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market.\n\n'[Al-Mosuli] said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors,' the report's author wrote.

Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.'\n\nMost of the organs are then smuggled out of Syria and Iraq into neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia or Turkey where criminal gangs sell them on to shady buyers across the globe, the Assyrian International News Agency reported.\n\nWhile organ harvesting may be the most shocking of IS' revenue streams, the report highlights a string of others that contribute to the group's $2million annual income.\n\nOne tactic is smuggling families and individuals into other countries.

Twitter\nOver the past week, social media has been abuzz with claims that young Kurdish female soldier Rehana was captured by the Islamic State militants and beheaded.\nThe Kurdish militia has neither denied nor confirmed the reports till now. The young Kurdish girl, who appears to be using pseudonym Rehana, became an online celebrity after a picture of her making a victory sign along with the caption, \"Rehana has killed more than 100 ISIS terrorists in Kobane\", was posted online by a journalist.\nThe female fighter for the Kurdish YPJ, or Women's Defense Unit, came to be regarded as a symbol of hope for Kurdish supporters overnight. Several supporters of the group have now come forward with evidence to prove that Rehana has not been beheaded.\nA Kurdish journalist, Rashad Abdel Qader, on his Twitter account stated that Rehana is alive. He also, however, pointed out that the claim that Rehana killed 100 ISIS fighters might be exaggerated. \"Spoke to #Rehana she's sound Re&amp; safe. #dailymail's is not true, she didn't kill 100 #ISIS but fighting fiercely #Kobanes,\"Rashad abdelQader @RashadAbdlQader tweeted.\nA report in 9News claimed that citing 'unconfirmed' reports that there are speculations about Rehana being killed by ISIS as the terrorist group had posted gruesome photos of 'her' decapitated body on the social media.\nAnother journalist and Kurdish supporter Pawan Durani @PawanDurani noted that it was all an ISIS propaganda. \"Let #ISIS produce even a single picture of Rehana .... Propaganda and falsehood runs in their blood .... Rehana keeps hunting them,\" Durani tweeted.\n?\nThe supporters also have posted a CNN video shot in Rojava-Kurdistan (Western Kurdistan) titled 'Is an enemy of ISIS a friend of America?' as proof that Rehana is alive.

The girl, who appears at 00:07- 00:08 minute in the video a holding a flag and a gun with light brown gunstock, (third from left) is Rehana.\nA Mirror report also noted that Kurdish resistance had denied the ISIS claims that they have beheaded poster girl 'Rehana.' The story, however, has no official statement from any of the Kurdish militia.\nThe young girl, who appears to be in her twenties, has become a symbol of Kurdish resistance movement against Islamic State. Rehana is one among a few hundreds of young girls fighting for the Kurdish Peshmerga militia, which has an Independent Women's Battalion known as the YPJ.\nThe female Kurdish fighters are literally the backbone of the Kurdish resistance movement in Kobani, also spelled Kobane. ISIS has much to gain from spreading rumours of death, especially in bringing down the morale of the Kurdish fighters.","We're at a loss for words right now.

After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn't make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don't tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don't ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won't do anything but make them hate them self. That's exactly what it did to me\u2026.\nWhen I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.\nI formed a sort of a \"fuck you\" attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that's obviously not what I wanted\u2026\nI have decided I've had enough.

ISIS militants reportedly killed 1,000 such soldiers yesterday\n\nDefence: Fierce fighting has been reported on the outskirts of Baghdad where ISIS militants are attempting to seize control of the Iraqi capital.

The location is considered a gateway to the Iraqi capital\n\nLocation: The militants are understood to have had their advance halted by airstrikes yesterday at Ameriyat Al-Falluja yesterday - a small city about 18 miles south of Fallujah and 40 miles west of Baghdad. But the clashes did not force the bulk of the fighters - with many of them now having made their way to the Baghdad suburbs\n\nReports that ISIS militants are now just one mile from Baghdad came from the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East - an organisation supporting the work of Canon Andrew White, vicar of the city's St George's Church, the only Anglican church in Iraq.\n\nIn a message posted on Facebook, the group said: 'The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has.\n\n'Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be hear a very short while to know they can do very very little,' they added.\n\nThe claims were backed up by Canon White himself, who shared the message just hours after he had earlier suggested the group were approximately six miles from the centre of Baghdad.\n\nIn a message he also posted on Facebook, Canon White had said: 'The Islamic State are now within 10km of entering Baghdad. Over a 1000 Iraqi troops were killed by them yesterday, things are so bad. As I said all the military air strikes are doing nothing.

We have females in aircrews and ground crews and they are here because of their abilities. Everyone is just doing their jobs.'\n\nThe involvement of a woman RAF pilot comes amid reports that the family of Major Mariam Al Mansouri of the United Arab Emirates, who flew an F-16 jet in bombing raids against positions in Syria last week, has disowned her.\n\nThe news comes as RAF jets flew armed sorties for a second day over Iraq yesterday \u2013 but again failed to locate any suitable targets for their weapons.\n\nDefence chiefs insisted that the flights by Tornado GR4 fighter-bombers were invaluable for gathering intelligence on the Islamist jihadists who have swept across large swathes of Iraq and Syria, carrying out massacres.\n\nBut the failure to unleash any firepower has fuelled concern that Britain is failing to pull its weight in the international coalition against Islamic State\n\nIt came as military commanders warned that Britain should brace itself to be dragged into a ground war in Iraq to crush IS, which is also known as Isis and Isil.\n\nFormer top brass also warned that the air campaign would be futile unless the UK could target the terrorists in Syria.\n\nWhile the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the RAF's third mission had \u2013 like on Saturday \u2013 failed to locate any targets, US-led coalition aircraft targeted four makeshift oil refineries under IS control in Syria, as well as a command centre.\n\nThe mobile refineries generate up to \u00a31.2million a day for the militants.\n\nOn a mission: The RAF jets seek out their terror targets in Iraq - which they failed to find and bomb, again\n\nStrong presence: Military leaders have said about two-thirds of the estimated 31,000 Islamic State militants were in Syria. But ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year, when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the country\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama has acknowledged that US intelligence agencies underestimated the threat posed by ISIS extremists in Syria, and overestimated the capabilities of the Iraqi army.\n\nObama added that breaking up the terrorist cell will be a complicated battle involving both military and political action.\n\nThe president spoke about the multi-national effort against ISIS in a televised interview with 60 Minutes, which aired Sunday night.\n\nCiting earlier comments by James Clapper, director of national intelligence, Mr Obama acknowledged that U.S. intelligence didn't take seriously enough what had been taking place in Syria.\n\n'Well I think, our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria,' Mr Obama said.\n\nConversely, the United States overestimated the ability of the Iraqi army to fight the militant groups, Obama said in the interview taped on Friday, days after the president made his case at the United Nations for action.\n\nPresident Obama says the US intelligence agencies underestimated Islamic State activity in Syria and overestimated the Iraqi army's role to fight back against militants\n\nSpeaking to CBS's 60 Minutes, he said the militants had used the chaos of the Syrian civil war, when large swathes of the country were ungoverned, to 'reconstitute themselves'\n\nMilitants: The terrorist-group ISIS has been taking large swaths of Syria and Iraq in the recent absence of a permanent U.S. military presence in Iraq\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group is growing, with dozens of countries among its ranks. The coalition is contributing a wide range of efforts, from carrying out airstrikes to providing military assistance and humanitarian aid.\n\nHere are some of the key partners in the coalition.\n\nUNITED STATES\n\nThe U.S., which is leading the coalition, has launched dozens of airstrikes on Islamic State targets. It also has sent military advisers, supplies and humanitarian aid to help Iraqi troops and Kurdish forces beat back the insurgents.\n\nGULF STATES\n\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have participated in airstrikes in Syria. A fourth, Qatar, has played what the Pentagon called a supporting role.\n\nThe Emirates and Qatar also host air bases that are being used for the coalition's aerial campaign against the Islamic State group. U.S. Navy ships involved in the airstrikes are assigned to the Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet. Saudi Arabia has agreed to host training facilities for Syrian rebels on its territory.\n\nJORDAN\n\nJordan has launched airstrikes against Islamic State positions, with government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani calling the move 'necessary in light of continuous attempts to infiltrate our borders.' The kingdom didn't give any specifics about its operations, but said the airstrikes aim to insure the country's security.\n\nEGYPT\n\nEgypt hasn't announced any specific participation in airstrikes, but President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi told the AP that Egypt is 'completely committed to giving support,' and will do 'whatever is required' to support the coalition.\n\nISRAEL\n\nIsrael is offering intelligence estimates and concrete intelligence to the U.S. on the Islamic State group as part of ongoing intelligence sharing between the two countries, an Israeli defense official said. But, he added, Israel wasn't asked to contribute anything beyond that. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the issue. The prime minister's office declined to comment.\n\nBRITAIN\n\nBritain said that Tornado fighter bombers, supported by air-to-air refueling aircraft and signals intelligence, are operating over Iraq. Britain's media has widely reported that six warplanes are on standby in Cyprus, but defense officials have declined to offer specific numbers. Ben Goodlad from IHS Jane's has said that the Tornado jets offer the coalition enhanced capability to engage moving targets. Britain also has two weapons for long-range strikes: the Tornado's Storm Shadow cruise missile and the submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missile, he said.\n\nFRANCE\n\nFrance has carried out airstrikes in Iraq on two occasions since joining the U.S.-led coalition on Sept. 19, firing laser-guided bombs from Rafale fighter planes upon munitions and military hardware stockpiles \u2014 first near northern Mosul, then on Thursday, near Fallujah. France is conducting the operations in Iraq from a French air base in the United Arab Emirates. The base, with about 750 French service personnel and six Rafales, is 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) from Mosul, meaning that the planes need refueling in flight to strike in Iraq.\n\nAUSTRALIA\n\nAn Australian air force contingent, including eight F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters and two support aircraft, has arrived in the United Arab Emirates. About 600 troops \u2014 most of them air force personnel \u2014 are being deployed with the aircraft. The jets are expected to be used in airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq, although the Australian government has yet to commit to a combat role.\n\nBELGIUM\n\nSix F-16 multirole fighters and a contingent of 120 support staff, including eight pilots, to be based in Jordan. Authorized to take part in operations over Iraq for one month, subject to extension if approved by the Belgian government.\n\nDENMARK\n\nDenmark has pledged seven F-16 fighter jets \u2014 four operational planes and three reserve jets along with pilots and support staff for 12 months. The U.S. also has asked Danes to provide military trainers to Iraq to school Iraqi and Kurdish fighters battling the Islamic State group on the ground. Denmark has already contributed a transport plane with personnel to a U.S.-led humanitarian operation in northern Iraq.\n\nCANADA\n\nCanada has contributed about 70 special operations soldiers to offer instruction to Kurdish forces battling Islamic State militants in northern Iraq. Early this week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Cabinet will be considering a U.S. request to support airstrikes against Islamic State forces. This could include five to eight CF-18 fighter aircraft as well as tanker aircraft. Canada has already contributed two military cargo planes that carried weapons to Kurdish fighters.\n\nGERMANY\n\nGermany isn't participating in any airstrikes against the Islamic State group. They have sent weapons to Kurdish fighters in Irbil, and a group of Kurdish peshmerga fighters arrived in Germany to receive weapons' training here by the German army. There's also German military in Irbil to train the peshmerga fighters in Irbil.\n\nGREECE\n\nGreece is participating with humanitarian aid and by sending ammunition for Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State group. They haven't specified any more details on quantities or type of humanitarian aid.\n\nGEORGIA\n\nGeorgia will be providing humanitarian assistance, not military aid, according to comments made by Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili on Thursday to local news websites.\n\nHUNGARY\n\nHungary has promised to send 15 types of ammunition totaling nearly 6 million units to Iraqi Kurds. Most of the ammunition, 4.1 million cartridges, was the M43 type for the AK-47 assault rifle.\n\nROMANIA\n\nPrime Minister Victor Ponta said his country would offer 'logistic, operational and humanitarian' support to the coalition, but not troops. He provided no details of the assistance.\n\nPOLAND\n\nPoland supports the coalition against the Islamic State, but is not actively engaged in combat.","(CNN) \u2014The cardiac arrest leading to Joan Rivers' death happened as the comedian's personal doctor began performing a biopsy on her vocal cords, a source close to the death investigation told CNN.\n\nJOAN RIVERS THROUGH THE YEARS\nJoan Rivers blurb\nJoan Rivers has passed away at the age of 81.

That procedure, intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, involved the insertion of a camera down her throat.\n\nAfter Cohen, the clinic's medical director, finished his work, a biopsy was done on Rivers without her prior consent, according to the source.\n\nAn ear, nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic as required by law performed a biopsy on her vocal cords.

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader the so-called Islamic State, is said to be among those targeted\n\nAmerican war planes have reportedly launched a strike on a gathering of ISIS leaders, critically wounding their leader.\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hurt in the strikes today, according to local witnesses and government sources.\n\nTwo witnesses confirmed that bombs had fallen on the town of al-Qaim, next to the Syrian border.\n\nLocal government sources described how an aircraft had swooped over a meeting of senior ISIS figures and dropped its payload, killing more than a dozen people.\n\nAnother witness said that eight people had died when a bomb struck a market.\n\nA local hospital was said to be overwhelmed with the volume of patients from the raid - including al-Baghdadi.\n\nLocal ISIS officials were reportedly roaming the streets with loudspeakers ordering residents to donate blood to help the wounded.\n\nStriking Baghdadi would be the most significant blow yet in the campaign against ISIS, who have been defiant in the face of sustained air attacks from the U.S. Air Force and allies.\n\nA provincial leader from Anbar in western Iraq, as well as his deputy, are said to be among those killed instantly by the bombs.\n\nAl-Qaim and the neighbouring Syrian town of Albukamal are on a strategic supply route linking territory held by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe so-called Caliph, who declared himself leader of all the world's Muslims in a televised speech, was formerly a prisoner of the U.S. during their occupation of Iraq.\n\nThe shady figure was eventually released, and rose through the ranks of the jihadist groups which eventually united to form ISIS, or the Islamic State.\n\nIraqi security officials could not immediately comment on the reported raid. The U.S. military did not confirm or deny the strike.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nAttacks: Two strikes were reported, one at al-Qaim, near the Syria-Iraq border, and a second in the ISIS stronghold of Mosul\n\nSeparately, the coalition of air forces, which includes Great Britain's RAF and Canadian fighter planes, struck a convoy just outside Mosul, ISIS's stronghold city in northern Iraq.\n\nU.S. officials would not confirm or deny whether Baghdadi, the group's overall leader, had been targeted, though one said that the coalition's airstrikes had not been targeting any particular meeting.\n\nIS-affiliated Twitter accounts rushed to deny the reports, with one tweeting: 'I can report to the Muslims that Amir Al-Momineen Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi Hafid hu'allah is alive and well.'\n\nPrisoner: al-Baghdadi, shown before his rise to power, was held as a prisoner by the U.S. during the occupation of Iraq\n\nThe hardline Sunni Islamic State's drive to form a caliphate in the two countries has helped return sectarian violence in Iraq to the dark days of 2006-2007, the peak of its civil war.\n\nIt has also created a cross-border sanctuary for Arab militants, as well as foreign fighters whose passports could allow them to evade detection in Western airports.\n\nThe U.S. strikes coincide with violence elsewhere in Iraq, after jihadist-style attacks hit the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.\n\nOn Saturday night a car bomb killed eight people in Baghdad's mostly Shi'ite Sadr City, police and hospital sources said.\n\nThe blasts bring to 28 the day's toll from bombs in the Iraqi capital and the western city of Ramadi.\n\nTwo bombs exploded in separate attacks in Baghdad's mainly Shi'ite Amil district, said a police source.\n\n'A driver parked his car and went to a cigarette stall, then he disappeared. Then his car blew up, killing passers-by,' the source said, describing one of the two attacks in Amil.\n\nIn the mostly Shi'ite al-Amin area of Baghdad, another car bomb killed eight people, medical sources said.\n\nThe attack by a suicide bomber on a checkpoint in Ramadi in Anbar killed five soldiers. 'Before the explosion, the checkpoint was targeted with several mortar rounds. Then the suicide humvee bomber attacked it,' said a police official.\n\nThere was no claim of responsibility for the bombings, but they resembled operations carried out by Islamic militants.\n\nIn the town of Baquba, 40 miles northeast of Baghdad, a gunman killed a Shi'ite militiaman, and a car bomb targeting a police officer killed his 10-year-old son, security sources said.\n\nAir strikes: The reports say that U.S. warplanes dropped bombs on the town of al-Qaim in Iraq. Pictured is an earlier strike against ISIS in Kobani, on the Turkey-Syria border\n\nWestern and Iraqi officials say U.S.-led air strikes are not enough to defeat the al Qaeda offshoot and Iraq must improve the performance of its security forces to eliminate the threat from the group, which wants to redraw the map of the Middle East.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has approved sending up to 1,500 more troops to Iraq, roughly doubling the number of U.S. forces on the ground, to advise and retrain Iraqis in their battle against Islamic State.\n\nThe Iraqi prime minister's media office said the additional U.S. trainers were welcome but the move, five months after Islamic State seized much of northern Iraq, was belated, state television reported.\n\nAbu Bakr Al-Baghdadi is the relatively discreet leader of the Islamic State extremist group.\n\nHe used to play for his mosque's soccer team and has a PhD in Islamic history.\n\nBut after spending four years in a US camp during the Iraq occupation, he emerged as one of the most brutal terrorists in the world.\n\nThe government placed a $10 million bounty on his head in 2011 when intelligence identified his movements as critically dangerous.\n\nThis warrant was publicized once more following the beheadings of US nationals James Foley and Steven Sotloff as well as Britons David Haines and Alan Henning.\n\nHe maintained a low profile for months as ISIS, the group's original name, rose to global infamy and Al Qaeda denounced them as 'too extreme'.\n\nBut he finally revealed himself to the public with a speech, filmed and posted on YouTube, in the first week of July this year.\n\nBorn Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri al-Samarri in 1971 near Samarra, Iraq, he came from a Sufi family - a tolerant form of Islam.\n\nIn the 1990s, he completed a PhD in Baghdad and played soccer with friends.\n\nBut he fell out with mosque leaders and fled to Anbar province where he joined Sunni groups protesting the US occupation.\n\nAmerican forces detained Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2005 shortly after the Iraq invasion. He was released when the camp closed in 2009.\n\nHe was thought to be 'bad but not the worst' sources told The Daily Beast.\n\nBut he then joined the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria, and rose up the ranks rapidly.\n\nAfter allegedly killing the leader, Abu Omar Baghdadi, he took hold of the terror group.\n\nThe United States spent $25billion on the Iraqi military during the U.S. occupation that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 and triggered an insurgency that included al Qaeda.\n\nWashington wants Iraq's Shi'ite-led government to revive an alliance with Sunni tribesmen in Anbar province which helped U.S. Marines defeat al Qaeda.\n\nSuch an alliance would face a more formidable enemy in Islamic State, which has more firepower and funding.\n\nPolice Colonel Shaaban Barazan al-Ubaidi, commander of a rapid reaction force in Anbar, said security forces retook eight villages.

AP Photo/Raqqa Media Center, File\n\nANTAKYA, Turkey \u2014 Middlemen with ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) have turned to a grim new method of trying to secure funds in recent days. With the group having failed to strike deals to ransom the U.S. hostages in its custody \u2014 instead beheading three of them since July \u2014 its intermediaries are now trying to negotiate the sale of the body of at least one of the men it killed.\n\nThree sources in contact with ISIS or its associates told BuzzFeed News that it wants to sell the remains of James Foley, the U.S. journalist whose August death was the first in a series of high-profile executions of Western hostages by ISIS hands.  They said ISIS wants $1 million for Foley\u2019s body, which it would deliver across the border to Turkey, and that the group was willing to provide a DNA sample to facilitate a deal.\n\nIf true, the attempted sale would highlight the ruthlessness behind the hostage-taking enterprise that has provided ISIS with deep reservoirs of funds and publicity \u2014 as well as the group\u2019s cold calculation as it works to raise more cash.\n\nAt one point early this year, ISIS held 23 Western hostages in Syria. Fifteen Europeans were freed as governments reportedly paid millions of dollars in ransoms, but the British and American hostages remained. Both governments refuse to negotiate for hostages or to allow families to pay ransoms. In the months since Foley\u2019s death, ISIS has released videotaped executions of the U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, the British aid worker Alan Henning, and the U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig. British journalist John Cantlie and a U.S. woman, a 26-year-old aid worker, remain in ISIS hands.\n\nAll three of the sources seeking to act as middlemen in a deal with the secretive extremists have been granted anonymity to protect their safety.\n\nOne, a former Syrian rebel fighter, has ties to ISIS commanders dating to the early stages of Syria\u2019s civil war. He said he has served as an intermediary in hostage negotiations with Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, and with ISIS. One day this fall, to prove his bona fides in the murky trade, he opened his iPhone to display unpublished videos of Western hostages in Nusra\u2019s custody.\n\nThis former rebel said he was approached by an ISIS leader who asked him to find a channel to either the U.S. government or Foley\u2019s family. Like the other sources, he noted a price of $1 million and the promise of DNA. \u201cThey ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will not give the DNA without the money.\u201d\n\nHe claimed his motivation was to help the grieving family find closure, calling his work \u201ca humanity case.\u201d\n\nAnother intermediary, a businessman who has sought to use his own ISIS connections to facilitate hostage deals in the past, was candid about his goals: \u201cThis is business.\u201d\n\nThe trade in Western hostages has created a shadowy marketplace in which middlemen like these seek to negotiate deals in order to receive commission. They might inflate their connections on one side of proposed negotiations in order to draw interest from the other, so they can make a case for being included in the transaction. The idea of selling Foley\u2019s body has drawn attention among some of these middlemen of late, according to a Syrian who was involved with previous negotiations with ISIS over U.S. hostages.\n\nBoth the former rebel fighter and the businessman said that one point person for the negotiations would be a senior official in the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the U.S.-backed rebel coalition, who was involved in previous ISIS talks over U.S. hostages as well as deals to free European ones. In an interview in Antakya, this FSA official expressed dismay that word of the attempted sale of Foley\u2019s remains had leaked. He urged this reporter not to publish an article on the subject, fearing that the attention could sabotage any potential deal.\n\nOf particular concern, he said, was that the U.S. government might seek to put a stop to it. Having allowed the U.S. hostages to die in ISIS custody, he reasoned, it would look bad if such a deal succeeded now. Foley\u2019s parents have said that the U.S. government threatened them with prosecution if they paid a ransom for their son\u2019s release. \u201cIt will be like a shame for the U.S. government,\u201d the FSA official said. \u201cPeople will ask why you brought the body but you didn\u2019t bring him when he was alive.\u201d\n\nThe FSA official described himself as the \u201cmanager\u201d of the proposed negotiations. He was in touch with a middleman representing ISIS, he said, and if a deal progressed would seek to arrange it with someone representing the Foley family.\n\nAs before, ISIS seemed intent on making money from its hostage enterprise by any means. \u201cThey were trying to negotiate (a ransom deal) for his freedom before they beheaded him, and after beheading him, they are trying to sell his body,\u201d the FSA official said.\n\nThe Foley family had no comment for this article.\n\nAn official with the U.S. State Department said \u201cwe are seeking more information\u201d on whether ISIS is trying to sell the remains of U.S. hostages. A senior U.S. diplomat called the idea \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\nWith additional reporting by Munzer al-Awad in Turkey.","The Peruvian TV show \"Harassing Your Mother\" performs secret makeovers on the mothers of habitual catcallers, then uses hidden cameras to record catcallers shouting sexual remarks at their own mothers, who furiously upbraid them in the middle of the busy streets of Lima.","The fussy female, dubbed the Black Widow, turned down the advances of a wannabe lover after she deemed his genitals unsatisfactory\n\nSome birds want the whole package.\n\nNone more so than a particularly demanding Snowy Owl in Poland, who KILLED her new boyfriend because of his tiny penis.\n\nThe bird, nicknamed the Black Widow, left her suitor half-eaten, shocking vets at the animal shelter in Knyszynska Forest.\n\nPark keepers had noticed the owl was unhappy and decided to pair her up with a new mate.\n\nBut just two days after arriving from Germany, they found the new owl devoured and dead.\n\nShelter spokesman, Robert Konowal, said: \"The first two days were fine and they seemed to get on very well.\n\n\"We were horrified when we then discovered she had killed him.\n\n\"At first we couldn\u2019t understand why but we took the remains to a vet who after examining him found that his testicle sack and private parts were underdeveloped.\n\n\"In other words, he wasn\u2019t a suitable lover, and we assume that after failing to perform she killed him, probably out of frustration.\n\nGetty   Murderer: The lonely female owl killed her mate because his penis was not big enough\n\n\"The Snowy Owl is beautiful but also brutal and we have nicknamed her the Black Widow.\"\n\nThe zoo confirmed that they were now looking for another snowy owl to be provided but said so far other facilities were reluctant to accommodate the request after the way the owl's last partner ended up.\n\nKonowal added: \"She may be a bit fussy but we're sure there's another owl out there who will meet her standards.\"\n\nClick below to see some cute animals who got along much better than these owls\n\nVIEW GALLERY","It's been a rough year for the tennis player, but at least he has his millions of dollars to ease the pain. 25-year-old Kei Nishikori has taken the No. 1 spot on People With Money\u2019s top 10 highest-paid tennis players for 2015 with an estimated $46 million in combined earnings.\n\nUPDATE 26/01/2015 : This story seems to be false.

The life I would\u2019ve lived isn\u2019t worth living in\u2026 because I\u2019m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy\u2019s body, and I\u2019ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally \u201cboyish\u201d things to try to fit in.\n\nWhen I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn\u2019t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don\u2019t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don\u2019t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won\u2019t do anything but make them hate them self. That\u2019s exactly what it did to me.\n\nMy mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.\n\nWhen I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn\u2019t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.\n\nI formed a sort of a \u201cf*** you\u201d attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that\u2019s obviously not what I wanted.\n\nSo they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t kill myself. I was completely alone for 5 months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent\u2019s disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness.\n\nAt the end of the school year, my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media. I was excited, I finally had my friends back. They were extremely excited to see me and talk to me, but only at first. Eventually they realized they didn\u2019t actually give a s**t about me, and I felt even lonelier than I did before. The only friends I thought I had only liked me because they saw me five times a week.\n\nAfter a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like s**t because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I\u2019ve had enough. I\u2019m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I\u2019m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I\u2019m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I\u2019m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I\u2019m never going to find a man who loves me. I\u2019m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There\u2019s no winning. There\u2019s no way out. I\u2019m sad enough already, I don\u2019t need my life to get any worse. People say \u201cit gets better\u201d but that isn\u2019t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.\n\nThat\u2019s the gist of it, that\u2019s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that\u2019s not a good enough reason for you, it\u2019s good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don\u2019t give a s**t which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren\u2019t treated the way I was, they\u2019re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say \u201cthat\u2019s f***ed up\u201d and fix it. Fix society. Please.\n\nGoodbye,\n\n(Leelah) Josh Alcorn","Ever since allegations against Bill Cosby resurfaced, fans who were in denial all these years have had to embrace the fifth stage of grief-acceptance.\n\nAs difficult as it is to imagine the vibrant-coloured-sweater wearing father figure -- who made us laugh through childhood all the way into adulthood -- could be a serial rapist, it is hard to ignore the latest accuser, Raven Symone who stole everyone's heart as little Olivia Kendall in \"The Cosby Show\".\n\nAccording to Hip-Hop Hangover, former child actor Symone told TMZ officials that she too had been drugged and raped by Cosby following the wrapping up of \"The Cosby Show\". The site claims that there were even rumours about Cosby disallowing Symone from appearing in the last season of the show initially and later abruptly changing his mind.\n\nAccording to a statement from her lawyer, \"...we among so many others are tired of the media worshipping and praising a man that has a past so terrible that it is unbelievable. My client (Raven-Symone) is also ready to tell her side of the story. A side that was kept quiet because of threats from being blackballed. There was no monetary compensation that made my client keep quiet, but more so the respect for Mr. Cosby. Well that respect has come to an end. And what we thought was a mistake or anomaly has surfaced to become a lifestyle. We will be pursuing damages that are not going to be disclosed at this time.\"\n\n\nBill Cosby with kids who appeared on \"The Cosby Show\". Cosby has been accused of rape by Raven Symone, who was a child star in the popular TV show.Reuters\nSymone's allegations strengthen the accusations of various other women including music industry publicist and journalist Joan Tarshis, actress Barbara Bowman and 15 others.\n\nIn one of the most revealing interviews, Tarshis told CNN that when she was just 19 years old, Cosby took her to his bungalow and gave her a drink, shortly after which she passed out. The next thing she remembers is him removing her underwear, she revealed. She went on to explain she used to \"idolise\" Cosby at the time and no one would have believed her anyway, which is why she refrained from coming out with the truth then.\n\n\"I assumed I was not the only girl that he was doing this with, but who's going to believe me? Bill Cosby, the all-American dad, the all-American husband, Mr Jell-O, the guy everybody loves. Who would believe me? They would probably think I was out to get something,\" Tarshis said.\n\n\n\nBowman, who also gave an all-revealing interview of her experiences with Cosby told CNN that she was thrilled at having him mentor her; a position he misused. One night while at his apartment, she passed out although she only had a single glass of wine.\n\nHer next memory is of doubling over a toilet bowl in her underwear and a men's t-shirt, as Cosby held her hair back. She went on to add that throughout their working relationship the drug-facilitated rapes continued.\n\nIn an article for The Washington Post Bowman wrote, \"as a teenager, I tried to convince myself I had imagined it. I even tried to rationalize it: Bill Cosby was going to make me a star and this was part of the deal.\"\n\nDuring their last sexual encounter, Bowman says she tried to wrestle from his grasp, \"until he eventually gave up, angrily called me 'a baby' and sent me home to Denver.\"\n\n\n\nMeanwhile \"The View\" co-host Whoopie Goldberg expressed doubts over Bowman's accusations and invited her to come on the program and answer a few questions directly.\n\n\"Quite honestly, you know, look, I'm sorry, having been on both sides of this where people allege that you do something, it doesn't matter now... I have a lot of questions for the lady. Maybe she'll come on,\" Goldberg said.\n\nMany women have alleged rape against Cosby since mid 2000s, however it was a 2-minute routine performed by comedian Hannibal Burress that brought it back to limelight. He said, \"Yeah, but you rape women, Bill Cosby, so turn the crazy down a couple notches,\" Buress said. \"I've done this bit on stage and people think I'm making it up.... when you leave here, Google 'Bill Cosby rape.' That sh** has more results than 'Hannibal Buress'\".\n\nWhile Cosby still remains silent on the rape accusations against him, a 1969 stand-up routine, ironically titled \"It's True! It's True!\" has him explaining how as a kid he had heard about a wonder drug -- \"Spanish Fly\" -- that would make a girl go crazy once it was put into her drink. He then goes on to speak of his interest in such a drug, which could have been a prelude to Cosby living his fantasy of stripping women of their ability to say \"no\".","An Egyptian man has reportedly delivered a financial blow to the Islamic State (Isis) by becoming \"emir\" of its alms department and then fleeing with almost one million US dollars to Turkey.\n\nAbu Obeida (or Ubaidah) al-Masri, secretary of the Zakat (charity) bureau and treasurer of IS Syrian branch, eloped with the funds amounting to \"billion Syrian pounds\" which have been collected by his department in Deir Ez Zour province, Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper reported, citing Syrian Press Center news site.\n\nAccording to some rumours, IS militants have issued an order to stop recruiting Egyptian jihadists because of the incident.\n\nThe claim could not be independently verified by IBTimes UK.\n\nIS imposed a Zakat tax on merchants and industrialists in the areas under its control in the north-eastern countryside of Aleppo.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Isis \"has forced the merchants and industrialists to pay 2.5% of each sale.\"\n\nThe merchants told the militants that they are already paying money to the poor families, but IS responded that those families should report to the Zakat bureau instead.\n\n\"The money paid to the poor without reference to the Zakat Chamber is an act of charity, but it doesn't exempt traders from paying to the Zakat Chamber,\" IS reportedly said.\n\nThe Zakat is the third Pillar of Islam and refers to the systematic giving of 2.5% of one's wealth each year to benefit the poor. The rate only applies to cash, gold and silver and commercial items.\n\nThis article originally appeared at International Business Times. Copyright 2015.

That's the same day the company is expected to unveil more details on its Apple Watch.\n\nThe maker of the iPhone and iPad mobile gadgets was close to releasing iOS 8.2 to the public earlier, blog Boy Genius Report said on Thursday, but instead decided to push out one final build to employees and testers. The change log for that build reveals several new features and enhancements in the health department as well as a host of bug fixes, according to BGR.\n\nThe Apple Watch faces an increasingly competitive market already crowded with devices from other players. To entice a wide range of buyers, Apple designed its first wearable as both a smartwatch and a health and fitness monitor. So the health features baked into iOS 8 need to be solid if Apple hopes to capture the fitness crowd.\n\nBased on the change log, the new and improved health features in iOS 8.2:\n\nadd the ability to select the unit of measurement for body temperature, weight, height, distance and blood glucose,\nimprove stability when dealing with large amounts of data,\ninclude the ability to add and visualize workout sessions from third-party apps,\naddress an issue that may have prevented users from adding a photo in Medical ID,\nfix units for vitamins and minerals,\nfix an issue where health data wouldn't refresh after changes in data source order,\nfix an issue where some graphics showed no data values, and\nadd a privacy setting that enables turning off tracking of steps, distance and flights climbed.\nBut iOS 8.2 is also designed as a bug squasher.\n\nLife hasn't exactly been easy for Apple's iOS 8 since it launched last September. The initial version carried a few bugs that were supposed to be resolved a week later in iOS 8.0.1. But that edition came with even more bugs, prompting Apple to quickly pull it and launch 8.0.2. Since then Apple has rolled out versions 8.1, 8.1.2 and 8.1.3, all with some enhancements and bug fixes.\n\nThe bugs and multiple releases may account for the sluggish adoption of iOS 8, which has trailed that of its predecessor but is finally up to 75 percent of all devices that visited the App Store as of last Monday.\n\nAccording to BGR, the bug fixes:\n\naddress an issue in Maps that prevented navigating to some favorite locations,\naddress an issue where the last word in a quick reply message wasn't autocorrected,\nfix an issue where duplicate iTunes purchased content could prevent iCloud restore from completing,\nresolve an issue where some music or playlists didn't sync from iTunes to the Music app,\nfix an issue where deleted audiobooks sometimes remained on the device,\nresolve an issue that could prevent call audio from routing to car speakers while using Siri Eyes Free,\nfix a Bluetooth calling issue where no audio is heard until the call is answered,\nfix a timezone issue where Calendar events appear in GMT,\naddress an issue that caused certain events in a custom reoccurring meeting to drop from Exchange calendar,\nfix a certificate error that prevented configuring an Exchange account behind a third-party gateway,\nfix an issue that could cause an organizer's Exchange meeting notes to be overwritten, and\nresolve an issue that prevented some Calendar events from automatically showing as \"busy\" after accepting an invite.\nThe update also promises greater stability for Mail, Music, the Flyover feature in Maps, VoiceOver reliability, and Connectivity with Made for iPhone Hearing Aids.\n\nA spokeswoman for Apple declined CNET's request for comment. But you can learn more about the Apple Watch and see if iOS 8.2 really will launch Monday by tuning in to CNET's live blog and show starting at 9 a.m. PT Monday.","Gwen Korovin, Joan Rivers\u2019s personal ear, nose and throat doctor who allegedly performed an unauthorized procedure on the late comedian while she was under anesthesia for an endoscopy, has denied taking a selfie with Rivers while she was in the procedure room.\n\nAccording to a report by CNN, Korovin \u201ccategorically denies\u201d taking the selfie, and also denies performing the unauthorized procedure on Rivers. Days ago, CNN reported that clinic employees told investigators the doctor took the photo and performed said procedure.\n\nSaid CNN:\n\nCNN\u2019s source close to the investigation also provided new details Thursday, including that a sedated Rivers was visible in Korovin\u2019s procedure room selfie. Clinic workers told investigators they heard Korovin make a statement to the effect that Rivers \u201cwill think this is funny\u201d or \u201cwould love this\u201d as she took the photo, the source said. Investigators do not have access to the phone Korovin used to take the photo, the source said.\n\nRivers went to Yorkville Endoscopy on Aug. 28 to find out why she had a sore throat and her voice was hoarse. CNN\u2019s sources maintain Rivers stopped breathing when her vocal cords began to swell, and she went into cardiac arrest. Rivers died Sept. 4 at age 81 after going on life support at Mount Sinai Hospital.\n\nPrevious reports stated Rivers stopped breathing after a botched attempt at a biopsy. CNN is now reporting that she stopped breathing after Korovin attempted a second laryngoscopy following an endoscopy. Korovin also performed a laryngoscopy prior to the endoscopy.\n\nHere\u2019s the letter Korovin\u2019s lawyer sent to the network:\n\nGwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city\u2019s most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients. As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient. For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin\u2019s personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients.","The calendar may have just flipped to 2015, but Saudi Arabia is partying like it's 1755.\n\nThe Daily Mail reports that Saudia, the kingdom's national airline, will introduce gender-segregated flights. Except close relatives, men and women flying on Saudia can reportedly look forward to assigned seating based on their naughty bits.\n\nThe discriminatory practice stems from multiple complaints lodged by male fliers who were unhappy that other men were allowed to sit next to their wives and female family members. Some men also objected to the conduct of a female flight attendant, which they deemed too \"flirty.\"\n\nThe change was first reported by Gulf media outlets, according to the Daily Mail. \"There are solutions to this problem,\" Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd told Ajel, a Saudi Arabian newspaper. \"We will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.\"\n\nThe airline will apparently include orders for flight-booking staff on the ground to make sure men and women are separated, Emirates247 reports. According to Mashable, however, a marketing manager for the airline is denying their plans to segregate passengers.\n\nSaudia already follows a variety of religious practices onboard, including the prohibition of alcohol and pork dishes and reading a Quran verse before takeoff. The airline also chooses not to hire Saudi women to work as cabin crew.\n\n\nSource: Getty\nSimilar complaints have been heard on flights traveling to Israel. In September, a flight headed to Tel Aviv from New York was delayed because several ultra-Orthodox Jewish men wouldn't sit next to women who weren't family members; more recently, a Delta flight was delayed for half an hour because ultra-Orthodox men refused to be seated next to women, and other passengers wouldn't change seats with them.\n\nOne Chicago woman started a petition on Change.org to stop the practice of forcing women to change seats, arguing that \"one person's religious rights do not trump another person's civil rights.\"\n\nShe's right, and the same could be said of discriminatory rules like those that Saudia reportedly plans to introduce. But given its already troubled history of the treatment of women \u2014 it was ranked the third-worst country in the Arab world for women \u2014 these new guidelines unfortunately appear to be more of the same.\n\nMic has reached out to Saudia for comment but received a message indicating that the company's inbox was full. We'll update if we hear back.","Microsoft Corp. is in serious discussions to buy Mojang AB, the Swedish company behind the popular \"Minecraft\" videogame, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe deal would be valued at more than $2 billion and could be signed as early as this week, this person said.\n\nA Microsoft spokesman declined to comment,...","Police in Niqiao village, a small region near Wenling City in east China's Zhejiang province report that a local man's penis was stolen by thieves while he slept, according to a report by the UK's British Star later picked up by the Huffington Post.\n\nThe 41-year old Fei Lin told police that he was sleeping when thieves burst into his room and put a bag over his head: \"They put something over my head and pulled down my trousers and then they ran off,\" Lin said. \"I was so shocked I didn't feel a thing\u2014then I saw I was bleeding and my penis was gone.\"\n\nWhile nobody has been apprehended yet, a report in the Austrian Times states that police believe the assailants were jealous or slighted lovers of several local women whom Lin was involved in romantically or sexually.

She just angrily called me a dog. She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realised that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex,\" said Khoza.\n\nKhoza said he had been dating the schoolgirl since December.\n\n\"We agreed to have sex, but she was not aware that I was filming the sex using my laptop computer. I did not intend to show anyone the video and I still\ndon\u2019t know how it got onto social media,\" he said.\n\nIn the viral video that AENS has seen to verify the claims, Khoza is seen pushing the girl, who was in her school uniform, to the bed. She appeared not to notice that she was being filmed while they had sex.\n\nThe remorseful Khoza added that although his penis would never work again due to the damage caused by the acid, he was lucky to be alive.\n\nHe said he was advised to press charges against the girl, but doesn't see the point.\n\n\"Even if I press charges it is useless because it won\u2019t bring back my manhood.

TMZ claims that it \"pressed to find out if she performed some other procedure\" but did not receive an answer.","On October 27, rumors began to spread on social media that a Kurdish female fighter known by the pseudonym Rehana may have been beheaded by Islamic State (ISIS) militants in Kobani.\n\nDubbed the \"poster child for Kobani female warriors,\" Rehana, a fighter in the Kurdish YPJ (People's Protection Units) militia, captured the public's imagination after her photograph was circulated on the internet. The image of Rehana making a \"victory sign\" was retweeted hundreds of times, along with the claim that she was singlehandedly responsible for killing over a hundred ISIS militants.\n\nWhile there has been no confirmation of Rehana's death, several news outlets, including Australia's 9News reported that she may have been beheaded, citing a graphic image of a beheaded Kurdish female fighter that had been shared on pro-IS social media accounts.\n\nThere is no way to verify if the image -- which shows an IS militant holding the head of a decapitated woman \u2014 is genuine, or if it is Rehana. However, the same gruesome photograph has been circulating since at least October 5 on pro-ISIS accounts.\n\nThe fact that the claims and rumors of Rehana's possible brutal killing have garnered so much attention is testament to the enormous public interest in female fighters in the Syrian Kurdish YPJ and Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga militias.\n\nReports have dubbed the women \"badass\", \"battle-hardened\" and \"fanatical\" fighters. The interest is unsurprising: these are all-female fighters waging war on ISIS militants, who are not only a formidable military force but whose repressive and violent Islamist ideology is in stark contrast to any progressive, feminist philosophy that allows women to go to war.\n\nThroughout the 40-day siege of Kobani, images of female Kurdish fighters have circulated widely on social media:\n\nWith a gun and a guitar... Kurdish female fighters in the streets of #Kobane #KobaneResistance! pic.twitter.com/fD1tWCwNht\n\nThis tweet included a photograph of Rehanna:\n\n#Airdrop2Kobane because Kurdish female fighters of the Women Protection Unit rather die than living under ISIS rule pic.twitter.com/UygfWa52DE\n\nThe images of young Kurdish women fighting for Kobani has also inspired artistic expression:\n\nFemale fighters of #YPG in #Kobane ! pic.twitter.com/k5n3v3Vnva\n\nThe widespread interest in Kurdish female fighters and their battle against IS militants in Kobani has given rise to a number of rumors, one of which \u2014 that ISIS militants are afraid of being killed by women soldiers because if a woman kills a muhajid (jihadi fighter), he won't go to Paradise \u2014 has become ingrained in the popular narrative about IS and the Kurds.\n\nHowever, the source of the rumor was not an ISIS scholar but a female Kurdish fighter.\n\nMany of the news and magazine reports about the Kurdish women militias lauded these fighters as \"inspirational\" feminists.\n\nYet are all-female Kurdish fighters really a sign that the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) -- or wider Kurdish society \u2014 is a bastion of feminism?\n\nThe Marxist-inspired PKK boasts one of the largest numbers of armed women militias in the world. According to the BBC, women have been integral to the Kurdish movement since the PKK's founding in 1978. At that time, it was strongly influenced by Marxist-Leninist ideas.\n\nHowever, the story of the PKK's all-female-militias is complex.\n\nThe PKK was one way for Kurdish women to advance themselves. (Norwegian academic Dr Kariane Westrheim told the BBC that Kurdish women had \"struggled hard to get their voices heard.\")\n\nWladimir van Wilgenburg, a Middle East analyst with the Jamestown Foundation specializing in Kurdish politics, says the hype over \"feminist\" Kurdish female militias is \"part of sensationalist reporting.\"\n\n\"There is a feminist tradition with the Kurdistan Workers Party based on the ideology of [PKK leader] Abdullah Ocalan. It's not much different from other Marxist rebel movements that have female fighters, but what makes it unique is that, in general, there are not a lot of political movements having female fighters. Especially not the Islamist ones,\" van Wilgenburg told RFE/RL.\n\nIn an op-ed in Turkey's Hurriyet News (Turkey considers the PKK to be a terrorist organization, as does the United States and the EU), Berfu Kiziltan of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva offers an even less rosy picture of the PKK.\n\nAccording to Kiziltan, while the PKK has historically recruited womenas well as men, some of the recruitment has been by force. More than half of the PKK's suicide attacks in Turkey have been carried out by women, because it was easier for them to evade security, and because suicide bombings allowed women a way to \"prove they could be as fierce as their male counterparts,\" she writes.\n\nAt least one Kurdish female fighter has also carried out suicide bombings in Kobani.\n\nEarlier this month, Kurdish fighter Arin Mirkan reportedly killed 10 IS militants when she blew herself up outside the northern Syrian town, the first report of a Kurdish female fighter carrying out a suicide attack in Syria.\n\nThis article originally appeared at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

According to the report, the Chinese group will make an offer of $15 per share to the BlackBerry as early as this week, with the deal finally getting done at around $18 per share.\n\nBlackBerry\n\nLenovo plans smart devices\n\nOn Wednesday, Lenovo stated that it is planning to launch its internet-based smart devices on Apr. 1, 2015. Also it was reported that the company will operate under a separate name and brand. A BlackBerry spokesperson told Benzinga that the company would not respond to rumors or speculations, and a Lenovo spokesperson was not available for the comment.\n\nLenovo CFO Wong Wai Ming said in January 2013 that the Canadian smartphone maker was under consideration from the company. However, BlackBerry declined any such possibility that time. Only last year, the government banned a potential BlackBerry deal with Lenovo due to some national security issues.\n\n\n\nBlackBerry shipment estimates lowered\n\nRecently analyst Todd Coupland at CIBC World Markets speculated that the estimated shipment volume for BlackBerry devices for the third and fourth quarters would be weak. Coupland added though that the initial demand for the BlackBerry Passport is encouraging compared to modest expectations. Coupland noted that on Google Trends, there was an increased search interest for the device that was similar to the BB10\u2019s number two devices. Also the Canadian company sold an unexpected 200,000 units of the Passport on the very first day of its launch.\n\nCoupland said, \u201cShipments, however, are being held back by supply constraints for unique screens and keyboards that will limit any upside in fiscal Q3.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, demand for BB7 and Z30 devices of BlackBerry is going down, therefore, shipment forecasts for BlackBerry devices have been revised down from 2.3 million units to 1.6 million units for the third quarter. Additionally, for the fourth-quarter, his shipment estimate is down from 2.5 million units to 1.5 million.\n\nBlackBerry CEO John Chen is expecting total shipments to hit 10 million units annually by 2017. Coupland says that the company still has a lot to do to revive its position in hardware before it can achieve its target and expects the company to ship only 6.8 million units in 2016 and 2017.","Microsoft -- the parent company of the Xbox and Windows brands -- is apparently \"in serious discussions\" to purchase Mojang, according to The Wall Street Journal.

It later migrated to iOS and Android before coming to Xbox 360 in 2012, where it sold like gangbusters.

While most hardware components of Apple Watch will mark high shipments during the same quarter, other key components are expected to see low production rate, which could result in a constrained supply, Kuo believes. A total of 2.8 million Apple Watch units, which come in three distinct collections such as Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sports and Apple Watch Edition, units are expected in Q1 2015. The iPhone shipment for the first quarter is likely to be more than 61 million units, whereas for iPad it is 10 million units. 12in MacBook Air  Kuo asserts that the upcoming 12in MacBook Air could make its international debut in the first quarter, with high resolution Retina display and a low-powered Intel Core M processor. Besides this, it is expected to be the first Apple product to take advantage of new reversible USB Type C connector for charging.

Some of those bodies are killed by bullets, some of them by knives. But when you find pieces of the back is [sic] missing and the kidneys is [sic] missing, you will wonder what it is.\nHis report reveals that the ISIS never fails to shock the world. He declared that the ISIS executed a dozen doctors in Mosul because they refused to cooperate to remove organs.\n\nAlhakim is replacing outgoing ambassador Nikolay Mladenov, who told the Security Council, \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that the tactics ISIS is using expand by the day.\u201d\n\nThe ISIS controls territory that includes the airports in Mosul in Iraq and Aleppo in Syria, giving it the ability to ship human organs to traffickers.\n\nHe said IS has access to airports in Mosul and in the Syrian city of Aleppo, from which it could transport the illicit organs to international middlemen and buyers.\n\nNo less shocking is that the Western world is treating the report as if it did not know months ago that the Islamic State has resorted to harvesting human organs.\n\nAl-Monitor reported last December 5:\nThe third funding source [besides oil sales and taxes on residents] was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling.\nSurgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.\n\nThe Western world, not least of all the Obama administration, chose not to disseminate the information in hopes of postponing the inevitable \u2013 a declaration of war on the ISIS.\n\nValuable time has been lost by imagining that the Islamic State is the problem of Iraq and Syria and not of the entire world.","South African police have been accused of not doing enough to crack down on a sick new sport that replaces fighting dogs with children.\n\nKids as young as nine-years-old are getting onto all fours and scratching and biting other children, growling and snarling in the process.\n\nAnd in a bizarre twist, the winners of the fights are rewarded just like a real dogs by allowing them to have sex with other children.\n\nAlthough the sex act is only simulated, it has shocked the country after it was revealed in local media to become a regular happening in the district of Ekurhuleni in the South African city of Johannesburg.\n\nInspector Wendy Willson from the special investigations unit at the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) confirmed that they had started an investigation after reports that pupils were returning from breaktime with torn clothing and injuries.\n\nTeachers then discovered the children were fighting each other in dog fighting role-play, while other pupils were placing bets on who would win. She said the activity had developed among children who had been watching real dogfights at the weekends with their parents and were mimicking the action at school. It is not clear if the children take part in the sport due to peer pressure or under encouragement of adults.\n\nWillson said she had witnessed the children getting down on all fours \u2013 barking, growling, biting and scratching each other.\n\nShe said: \"They rip into each other.

Quite apart from the mandatory hairstyle, the rapid weight gain, and the did-he-or-didn\u2019t-he execution games, lately, the supreme leader has kinda just\u2026 disappeared. The usually spotlight-loving head of state is not in the press, not at events, and not at meetings. That\u2019s right, Kim Jong-un has been missing for several weeks, and no one\u2019s quite sure why.\n\nThe last time that Kim made a public appearance was Sept. 3, when he went to a concert with his wife. Since then, the media hasn\u2019t heard a peep from the dictator. According to the AP, on Thursday he didn\u2019t even show up to the reopening of North Korea\u2019s Supreme People\u2019s Assembly, a super high-level meeting at the Pyongyang parliament. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s missed such an important event since 2011, when his father died.\n\nThere are a lot of questions one could ask about the North Korean dictator. Does he really rule the country, or is he simply under the thumb of the intriguing Organization and Guidance Department? Does he really love theme parks and brutal prison camps simultaneously, or are the water slides just an image booster? Why would anyone ever want a mushroom-flavored sports drink? But the most important question is this: Why, oh why, is he hiding?\n\nHere are three reported reasons the North Korean dictator is lying low.\n\nPossible Reason No. 1: Cheese, Apparently\n\nIt\u2019s true. Several news sources, including The Daily Mirror, are suggesting that most sinister culprit: Emmental. Apparently, Kim really, really loves the Swiss cheese (who doesn\u2019t?), and has huge amounts imported for his own personal consumption (I would too, if I could). But it\u2019s possible he\u2019s been enjoying the delicious snack just a little too enthusiastically \u2014 he\u2019s gained a lot of weight really quickly, and the media noticed that the last time he was in public, he was walking with a limp.\n\nIn other words, the North Korean leader may be out of action because he\u2019s made himself ill by eating too much cheese. Strangely, this is the most endearing I\u2019ve ever found the dictator.\n\nPossible Reason No. 2: Gout\n\nAnother explanation for the weight gain and limp: gout. In fact a type of arthritis, gout causes intense pain and sometimes weight gain (so maybe, it\u2019s not all the Emmental\u2019s fault after all). Michael Madden, a journalist for the 38 North website, said that \u201cbased on his gait, it appears he has gout \u2014 something [due to] diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the Kim family.\u201d\n\nPossible Reason No. 3: Security\n\nOf course, North Korea always has internal political and military struggles going on, and this isn\u2019t even first time that Kim has lain low \u2014 back in 2012, he went missing from the media spotlight for two weeks without any explanation. So some are interpreting his disappearance as nothing more than a precautionary security measure. As Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Waseda University in Tokyo, told the Daily Telegraph:\n\nAnother reason why Kim may be reluctant to appear in public is the ongoing power struggle inside the North Korean military, which means that the situation in Pyongyang is still unstable.\n\nIt\u2019s possible. On Friday, state media confirmed for the first time that Kim\u2019s health isn\u2019t too good, acknowledging that he\u2019s been dealing with some \u201cdiscomfort.\u201d Hmm, seems like a cheese-related problem to me.

Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim called for a Security Council investigation into alleged mass graves full of bodies with surgical scars and missing kidneys.\n\nAccording to Alkalim, a dozen doctors have been killed in Mosul because they wouldn't take part in the Islamic State's organ trafficking scheme.\n\nUnconfirmed rumors of ISIS removing and selling organs have been around since at least December, when Middle East news outlet Al-Monitor published an article with more detailed claims than Alkalim made this week.\n\nBased on a report from one doctor in Mosul, Al-Monitor wrote:\n\nSurgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs ... the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.\n\nHe said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said.\nThe Al-Monitor story also claims that the U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed \"the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest,\" a claim that was widely repeated by news sites in December, but seems to be based entirely on this single source. (As far as I can tell, there's no mention of the trafficking operation in OHCHR's published reports on Iraq, and Alkalim didn't mention OHCHR in his statement to the Security Council.)\n\nThe Islamic State is incredibly money-hungry, Newsweek reported in a detailed look at the revenue streams ISIS uses to support the 8 million people in its territories, including more than 10,000 active fighters. There's no mention of selling kidneys, but ISIS needs all the money it can get, and if they're willing to conduct small-time local kidnappings for as little as $500, moving organs isn't so farfetched.\n\nThere's still no conclusive evidence, though. The Islamic State is the international boogeyman of the moment, and its confirmed actions are heinous enough to make any rumor sound plausible, but it's also been the subject of several online hoaxes and conspiracy theories.\n\nIt's probably best to withhold judgment until the U.N. does what Alkahim suggests and examines the bodies.","Apple is forecast to have shipped a whopping 73 million iPhones over the 2014 holiday quarter on strong iPhone 6 demand, according to one well-connected analyst who also expects a busy start to 2015 for the company, with Apple Watch sales in March and a rumored 12-inch MacBook Air coming sometime before April.\n\nIn a research note from well-connected KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo obtained by AppleInsider, Apple's latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models led a charge to 73 million overall unit sales for the quarter ending December. The analyst estimates the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 to hit more than 42 million, while the larger 5.5-inch iPhone 6 \"phablet\" contributed with just over 16 million unit sales.\n\nIf the numbers hold up, Apple is in for a record-smashing holiday quarter. Kuo's estimates are well above expectations from other leading investment banks including UBS, which earlier this month forecast Apple to sell 69 million iPhones.\n\nMomentum from Apple's iPhone 6 lineup will spill into the first quarter, driving overall iPhone shipments to an about 61.7 million unit sales. A performance of that caliber would buffer seasonally slow sales.\n\nConsistent with the latest reports, Kuo also expects the highly anticipated Apple Watch to launch in March. While Apple has stayed mum on exact specifications, the company could fill in the blanks with a special announcement prior to the device's debut, the analyst said.\n\nAssuming a March launch, Apple Watch is expected to sell 2.8 million units in the first quarter, meaning those sales will be spread across a relatively short one-month span. Kuo says most component suppliers will see shipments in the 4 million to 5 million unit range through the March quarter, but a few manufacturers are seeing low yields on key parts, slowing down final assembly and shipping.\n\nOn Apple's rumored 12-inch MacBook Air with Retina display, Kuo is forecasting a ship-by date sometime this quarter. The all-new thin-and-light, said to sport a Retina display, ultra-thin form factor and Intel's latest mobile chips, will help fuel a 2.6-percent quarter-over-quarter increase in Mac shipments. Kuo expects Mac sales to hit 6 million units for the first three months of 2015, up slightly from 5.9 million forecast for Q4 2014.\n\nAside from industry scuttlebutt, not much is known about Apple's ultraportable newcomer. A set of photos posted online yesterday purportedly show the laptop's display assembly, which boasts edge-to-edge glass with black bezels and eschews the usual translucent Apple logo for a polished insert more in line with the latest iOS devices.\n\nFinally, Kuo sees drooping sell through for iPad as Apple's recently released iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 models largely failed to move the needle during the holiday season. For the December quarter, estimates put iPad shipments down 17.8 percent year-over-year to 21.4 million units. Moving into the first quarter of 2015, iPad could hit 10.1 million unit sales, but the number is still weak, down 38 percent compared to the same time last year.\n\nInterestingly, Kuo models a rise in shipments for older iPad versions during the March quarter while at the same time revising down previous estimates of iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3. The analyst adjusted his numbers to reflect challenges Apple's tablet is facing with shifting market headwinds.","People wanting to buy an Apple Watch may be able to ask for a custom engraving, much as the company has allowed with products like the iPad and iPod before it, although the option may not be available in time for the product's launch.\n\nThen information comes French website iPhonote, citing a source claimed to be tied to Apple. The person allegedly said they are virtually certain engraving will become available, whether sooner or later.\n\nIf the company follows its past pattern of past engraving options, such as with the iPad and iPod, only online orders will qualify.\n\nOne question is where an engraving would fit on the diminutive, wearable Apple Watch. There is very little space around the bezels of the Watch, and the underside is dominated by a heartrate sensor, as well as some of Apple's own markings such as the serial number.\n\niPhonote is relatively unknown site with no established track record. Apple does however have a history of offering engravings for iPhones, iPods, and iPads.\n\nConventional watches are frequently engraved, moreover, and the option would make sense given Apple's emphasis on personalization in official marketing. The company has taken the Watch to a number of fashion magazines, and highlighted different combinations of body materials and wrist straps.\n\nMore details about the product are due to be announced at a Monday press event, whee AppleInsider will be in attendance with live coverage. The company is already preparing San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center by raising Apple logos and building an exterior structure thought to house a demonstration area.","Apple is installing safes in its retail stores ahead of the launch of its Watch in April indicating just how expensive the gold model will be.

This is Alex's mum. I don't know what has happened between you and my partner, Derek. I was very shocked to see the invoice in Alex's school bag. I did not realise that you had to pay for each child, as you never mentioned anything about money when we spoke. The only reason Alex did not attend the party was because his nan and grandad were going away for christmas and the only day the kids could go see them was on the same day as the party. I did not know this. On the day Alex decided that he wanted to spend time with his nan and grandad. I apologise for not letting you know, but I did not have a phone number or an e-mail for you to let you know the situation(I also didn't know your first name, or I would have looked you up). If I had known that I would have to pay if Alex did not go, then I would have paid you the money, no problem. I do not like fighting with people, and would prefer to settle this amicably.\n\nJulie Lawrence\n\nHi Tanya, I didn't mention the money when we spoke because it was a child's party, it doesn't matter if you have to pay per person or for a group if people agree to going, I confirmed that with all parents on the Thursday before the party that they were going as I had to pay that day, and Derek told me Alex was looking forward to it and would see us there, to me that is confirmation. My phone number was on the invitation that was sent out to Alex. I don't like fighting with people either, and was not best impressed when Derek turned up on my doorstep, and said you won't get any money out of me, rather rudely, I do admit it rattled me. This is not the first time Alex has not turned up to a party that he has been invited to, either. the amicable way round this I believe would be to pay me the money and let a lesson be learnt, I hope this is agreeable ? Julie\n\nTanya Walsh\n\nHi Julie, who's party is Alex supposed to have gone to? I did speak to another mum about a party but she never got back to me with details, other than that I don't recall any other confirmed invites. The only reason Derek was angry was because of the fact that the envelope was put into Alex's school bag, when it has nothing to do with the school. He spoke to the headteacher about and she said that it's against school policy to do that kind of thing. Birthday invites are fine, but not personal items. Like I said before, no money was mentioned when we spoke, and I feel it would be inappropriate to pay you the money, when I don't know what it's actually paying for. Alex was very excited to go to the party. I didn't know until the day about his nan and grandad, and he decided he would rather spend the day with them. Like I said before I didn't have your number to let you know. And exactly what lesson would I be learning. I am not a child, so please do not speak to me like I am one. So, to answer your question, unfortunately no. This is not agreeable.\n\nJulie Lawrence\n\nYou are paying for 1 x child's party at the ski slope including snow tubing and tobogganing and lunch, to with you said Alex was attending on the Thursday\n\nTanya Walsh\n\nJust so you know, small claims court cost #60 just to start a claim. Also I'm not paying for something we didn't use.\n\nJulie Lawrence\n\nIt doesn't cost that much\n\nTanya Walsh\n\nIt does. Also I don't think the school are very happy with you involving them in this either. I don't know why you are out for our blood and slandering us. I've told you the reasons why alex didn't go. I also told you why I couldn't call. You also don't seem to understand that I never ran away from you. I didnt hear you calling after me. I have to get to my daughter at carbeile. So if they let alex out last then I have to rush a bit because evie, my 2 year old, walks slow. So maybe that's why you thought I was rushing off. I had no reason to run to run away from you. So please do not state things as truth when you do not have all the facts. Maybe if you actually spoke to me rather than making your own mind up about what happened then none of this would be happening right now. If you had come up to us the first day back and explained about the money, then I could have explained about alex, then maybe we could have sorted something out. Instead you send an invoice.","According to a Saturday Benzinga report that references \u201ca source familiar with the matter\u201d, it has been revealed that Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group (OTCBB:LNVGY) could make an offer to acquire Canadian telecommunication and wireless equipment company BlackBerry Ltd.

Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Photo: AP\n\nBeirut: The fate of the self-proclaimed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi remains unclear, with rumours that he was wounded in a US air strike in Iraq still unconfirmed.\n\nThe United States Central Command said coalition aircraft did conduct a series of airstrikes on a convoy in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul where it is thought there was a gathering of Islamic State leaders.\n\nIt is believed there were at least 50 casualties from the attack.\n\nHowever Colonel Patrick Ryder, a spokesman at Central Command, said: \"We cannot confirm if ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was among those present,\" the Guardian reported.\n\nOne of Baghdadi's key aides, Abdul Rahman al-Athaee, is known to have died in the attack and as he was known to travel with the leadership it has prompted a raft of speculation as to the well-being of Baghdadi.\n\nA Twitter account purported to be run by an IS spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, appeared to confirm the self-declared caliph had been injured.\n\n\"Perhaps you suspected that the caliphate ended with martyrdom of the caliph. I assure the [Islamic] nation that the Emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is well thank God, and I wish him a speedy recovery.\"\n\nHowever commentators have cast doubt on those comments, with some labelling the Twitter account a fake.\n\nTwo people who say they witnessed an airstrike on a house near the western Iraqi border town of al-Qaim where senior Islamic State officials were meeting told Reuters the militants had evacuated a local hospital so their wounded could be treated.\n\nMeanwhile, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official told Associated Press on Sunday that the strike on al-Qaim in Anbar province had wounded Baghdadi, while a senior Iraqi military official also said he had heard Baghdadi had been wounded in the attack.\n\nBaghdadi's last public appearance was in a mosque in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul in July, in which he declared himself the leader of a new caliphate that stretched from Syria into Iraq.\n\nOne commentator and author, Juan Cole, cautioned against placing too much hope that \u2013 should the death of Baghdadi be confirmed \u2013 the Islamic State would be weakened.\n\n\"The US has killed a long line of al-Qaeda leaders by now, from Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in 2006 to Bin Laden himself,\" Mr Cole wrote on his Informed Comment blog on Sunday.\n\n\"The military's theory that leadership is rare and attrition wrought on leaders is decisive in defeating a group is simply incorrect. ISIL's toolbox of terrorising and coercing people is available to large numbers of people.\"\n\nBritain's chief of defence staff, General Sir Nick Houghton, also warned that Islamic State would regroup if its leader had been killed.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, General Houghton said: \"What I wouldn't want to do is rush to the sense that the potential death of one of their totemic leaders is going to create some strategic reverse within [IS].\n\n\"They will regenerate leadership \u2026 because of the current potential attractiveness of this warped ideology.

The law was passed in order to counteract a legend that led to the death of Argentine boys. According to the legend, the seventh son, born after six boys without any girls in-between, becomes a werewolf whose bite can turn others into a werewolf.\nThe belief in the legend was so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.\nThe law only applied to the biological children of Catholic families until the enacting of a presidential decree in 2009, which allows children from other religions to qualify.\nThe boys receive presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until his 21st birthday.\nShlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied.

Aside from setting up a third mobile business to target China specifically, rumors are resurfacing that Lenovo is eying to buy BlackBerry out of its woes. Or perhaps the two moves are one and the same, which doesn't make sense either. Whatever Lenovo has planned, we might very well know this week as sources close to the matter tip that Lenovo will be making an offer to buy BlackBerry sometime this week.\n\nThis isn't exactly the first time that the largest PC maker has set its eyes on BlackBerry. It was exactly a year ago since we last heard about the Chinese firm's interest in the Canadian company. Of course, neither company confirmed nor denied the matter. The Canadian government, however, was allegedly working in the background to have it blocked, due to security concerns of a Chinese company buying out a Canadian one.\n\nFast-forward to today, Lenovo is said to make a $15 per share offer to BlackBerry, possibly ending up at around $18 per share. If any of this is true, Lenovo would be what others would call it spreading itself thin across continents. It was lately rumored to be planning on starting a new mobile phone venture in China specifically to rival top dog Xiaomi while still maintaining its own Lenovo branded smartphones in that country. In the US, it is still waiting to conclude the acquisition of Motorola Mobility, whose name and sales also extend to other countries. If it does or at least tries to acquire BlackBerry, then it means that the company is willing to have a fourth mobile business under its control.\n\nThe other big question is whether BlackBerry is willing to sell. There have been many rumors and offers during the height of the company's financial crisis, none of which have come to pass as BlackBerry has soldiered on to keep its own brand and business under its own direction. If you only look at news coverage, the company doesn't seem to be in as dire straits, which makes the prospect of a buyout even less enticing. Plus, the company has just launched a fresh new attempt at both the smartphone and the enterprise market, and isn't exactly done yet. Whether those are actually enough to keep BlackBerry afloat is too early to tell, which might be another reason it would not be so interested in an acquisition.\n\nVIA: Benzinga","The unidentified woman was struck on the hand on Alaska Airlines Flight 567 to Portland, Oregon, as it was taxiing on the runway.\n\nAn airline spokesman said that the plane returned to the gate and the woman received medical attention before disembarking.

The report further claims that Apple has already fitted these safes at many of its stores.\nIt is likely that there will be a different sales process for the Apple Watch Edition models given that they\u2019re likely to be very expensive.

Why did she do it? It\u2019s simple really. Due to Argentinian folklore, the president was required to adopt the boy in order to prevent him from turning into a werewolf. At least that\u2019s what people believed. From New York Daily News:\n\nAccording to tradition in the country, the seventh son born to a family turns into a werewolf, a feared \u201cel lobison\u201d.\n\nThe creature only shows its true nature on the first Friday after the boy\u2019s 13th birthday, turning the teenager into a demon at midnight during every full moon.\n\nA demon at midnight? Do tell\u2026\n\nAs well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.\n\nFear of the lobison was so rife in 19th Century Argentina that some families abandoned or even murdered baby boys \u2013 an atrocity that sparked the unusual Presidential practice of adoption, aimed at stopping the deadly stigma. (Via)\n\nThe problem here is that all of it is bullsh*t. According to The Guardian, it is a nice mixture of folklore and truth that fooled plenty of people and may have had them running for the silver:\n\nLike all good urban myths, the articles were based on a grain of truth: by tradition, the seventh son (or daughter) born to an Argentine family is eligible to become the godson (or daughter) of the president. Until this month, the honour had only been bestowed on Christian babies, but on Wednesday, Iair Tawil \u2013 not a baby, but the strapping 21-year old son of a rabbi \u2013 became the country\u2019s first Jewish presidential godson\u2026\n\n[Somehow], the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobiz\u00f3n (Argentina\u2019s equivalent to the European werewolf). According to some versions of the myth, the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse.\n\nThat makes the entire thing infinitely less appealing.

Apple has previously stumbled in this arena with a music-centric social network called Ping that went largely unused and was discontinued in 2012. So it makes sense that it might want to start with someone else's (quite functional and flashy looking) foundation to bring a native social experience to its iOS devices.\n\nPath was founded in 2010 by ex-Facebooker Morin and Napster co-founder Shawn Fanning. In five rounds of funding to date, the company has received $77 million in investments from 40 different investors.\n\nPath was originally conceived as a companion network to Facebook for people to enjoy higher engagement with a smaller number of quality friends and contacts. It specifically limited users to 150 in-network connections as a tip of the hat to Dunbar's number, an idea in anthropology stating human brain size is such that we can only support meaningful relationships with 150 people. Where Facebook would be a place for wishing distant acquaintances a noncommittal happy birthday, Path would be specifically for sincere communications with your smaller, closer circle of friends and family.\n\nThe company released its app first on iPhone, later following up with apps for Android, Windows Phone and iPad. While it only boasts 25 million users (a far cry from the userbase of social giants like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat), the app is quite glamorous-looking and loaded with simple visual appeal. You might consider its news feed a list of stylized Facebook updates from people you actually want to hear from.\n\nA screenshot of the Path iPad app.  Path\n\nApple and Path already have history together. Not only is Path's Morin a former Apple employee who worked in the company's marketing and product division from 2004-2006, but Path also made a fairly major error surrounding iOS user privacy in 2012. Its app uploaded iPhone users' complete contact lists to its servers, which led to Apple CEO Tim Cook responding to letters from the U.S. Congress about how Apple responds to user privacy. A second privacy flub in 2013 saw Path pay an $800,000 penalty to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for storing information belonging to underage users; it agreed to independent privacy assessments every other year for the next 20 years.\n\nPath has had its problems, but its product -- a walled garden for more-intimate socialization with your closest friends -- is strong and functional.\n\nApple has yet to build a social experience people want to use habitually, so this acquisition would be a sensible one. If and when it becomes official, we'll be standing by for the specifics.","The Islamic State of Syria and Iraq has reportedly released a video showing the beheading of Steven Joel Sotloff, a U.S. journalist being held by the group.\n\nThe New York Times, Reuters and the Washington Post cited a report from the SITE Intelligence Group on the video that purportedly showed Sotloff's killing.\n\n\nSotloff, who has reported for Time magazine and Foreign Policy, has been missing since August 2013. In the video that showed the murder of American journalist James Foley, an ISIS militant brought Sotloff in front of the camera and threatened his life (pictured above via AP).\n\nThe news broke moments before the daily White House press briefing began. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said he was \"not in a position to confirm the authenticity of the video or the reports.\"\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers first and foremost are with his family and those who worked with him,\" Earnest said.\n\nThis post has been updated.","Apple rumors don\u2019t stop, and today there\u2019s a fresh one that discusses what we might be able to expect from the iPhone 6s later this year. Today\u2019s rumors sound a bit outlandish, but not out of the question.\n\nAccording to Money.UDN, the iPhone 6s will pack new camera features, including a dual-lens camera with a built-in optical zoom function. Optical zoom allows you to take clearer shots when zooming in on a subject, as opposed to software-enabled zoom which often leaves the subject looking blurry or grainy. Storage options may also change.\n\nUDN cites supply chain sources who suggest Apple will continue to offer the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes, but will bump the entry-level iPhone 6s/iPhone 6s  Plus storage to 32GB instead of 16GB. There\u2019s also reportedly some new display technology at work.\n\nAnother supply chain \u201clegend\u201d discussed by UDN suggests that the iPhone 6s will employ \u201ctwo pressure sensors\u201d one of which will have a role in health monitoringfunctions, offering more accurate ways to track a user\u2019s heart rate and blood pressure. The site also lists a \u201c3D pressure sensor\u201d that may be built into the touch panel for an additional Z axis. To us, that suggests possible 3D user-interface interactions, though UDN instead points to 3D imaging technologies that might take advantage of the pressure sensor.\n\nOne of those rumors lines up with a patent Apple received in April of last year, which discussed presssure-sensitive touchscreen technology that allows the display to distinguish between soft taps and stronger, more forceful inputs; that technology is also making its way into the Apple Watch.\n\nWacky? Maybe a bit, and the supply chain is often filled with outlandish rumors but, again, none of this seems completely out of the question. Whether these rumors come to fruition or not\u2026 well, we won\u2019t know until closer to September 2015.","Fisherman Igor Vorozhbitsyn is lucky to be alive - after his Justin Bieber ringtone went off while he was being attacked by a bear.\n\nIgor, 42, thought he was a goner when the brown bear pounced on him as he was walking to a favourite fishing spot in northern Russia's Yakutia Republic.\n\nBut as the bear began to claw at him, Igor's mobile went off and the beast turned tail and fled back into the forest.\n\nWildlife experts believe the ringtone - according to local media the singer's hit 'Baby' - must have startled the bear into halting its attack.\n\n\"Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,\" explained one.\n\nIgor suffered from cuts and severe bruises to his face and chest and was rescued when he was found by other fishermen after using the phone to call for help.\n\nIgor - now recovering from his mauling - explained: \"I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I'd marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me.\"\n\n\"I couldn't believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled.\n\n\"I know that sort of ringtone isn't to everyone's taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke,\" he added.","A scorpion stung a woman on an Alaska Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Portland, Ore., Saturday night, according to media reports from the West Coast.\n\nThe incident happened after the plane pulled back from the gate and was taxiing out, airline officials told ESPN.

Wayne Tinkle, Oregon State's head coach, tells ESPN the scorpion situation occurred just two rows in front of him.\n\n\"The plane was coming from Mexico before us, and [the scorpion] was on the plane,'' Tinkle tells ESPN's Andy Katz. \"The woman was a real champ. She acted like it was a mosquito bite.

The woman declined additional treatment.\n\nThe Oregonian newspaper also confirms Tinkle's account of how the scorpion made it onto the aircraft, writing: \"Passengers were told the scorpion hitched a ride in the carry-on bag of a passenger who had been to Mexico.\"\n\nThe flight was delayed by about 30 minutes to respond to the sting.

Cringely, author of The Decline and Fall of IBM, says the notices could go out as soon as next week after IBM reported shrinking profits for an 11th quarter.\n\nIBM stock falls 7% after it downgrades earnings forecast\nThe tech giant, which relies on service contracts for a significant portion of its cash flow, is suffering as companies shut down their internal data centres and move services to the cloud.\n\nIBM could lay off 26 per cent of its workforce of 430,000, which would mark the largest corporate layoff in history. Big Blue holds the previous record for huge cuts, after laying off 60,000 workers in 1993.\n\n\nCringely predicts the bulk of the layoffs will be in the U.S., and affect mainframe and storage divisions. Citing unnamed sources inside IBM, he says the company has been planning a reorganization dubbed Project Chrome to boost its earnings.\n\nIBM recently announced the new Z13 mainframe, but that is unlikely to protect jobs in the mainframe division.\n\nIt also bought cloud services provider Softlayer and is opening cloud data centres around the world, including one in Canada, in an effort to move to a new business model. However, it is behind rivals such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon in adapting to cloud computing.\n\nCloud offerings at IBM are expected to bring in $3.1 billion on an annualized basis in 2014, only a fraction of IBM\u2019s total $100 billion in revenue last year.\n\nIn his book, Cringely blames poor management and lack of vision for IBM\u2019s decline.","No one knows exactly where he came from. No one knows why he was chosen to lead the Islamic State. And now, in the past 24 hours, reports have arrived saying Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is \u201cbelieved dead,\u201d or merely wounded, or \u201ccritically wounded,\u201d or unscathed \u2014 or possibly not even at the scene of the attack.\n\nFollowing U.S. airstrikes targeting Islamic State commanders attending a clandestine meeting over the weekend, few reports agree on the facts. Meanwhile, American commanders can\u2019t or won\u2019t say whether or not he was even there or not, let alone hurt.\n\nThe drama and ensuing confusion is fitting for Baghdadi, a shadowy figure whose myth may only be enhanced by the mystery surrounding his purported demise.\n\nThe saga deepened on Sunday when Iraqi Defense Minister said on Facebook that Baghdadi\u2019s deputy was killed and that the self-described caliph was injured in the attack. Then Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said to be the Islamic State\u2019s spokesman, dispatched his own update. \u201cPerhaps you suspected that the Caliphate ended with martyrdom of the Caliph,\u201d the Jerusalem Post quoted him saying. \u201cI assure the [Islamic] nation that the Emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is well thank god, and I wish him a speedy recovery,\u201d the implication being that he was at least injured.\n\nIf so, he would have escaped a fate that claimed other prominent Islamic leaders. The assassinations began in 2006. That year, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of an earlier iteration of the Islamic State, was killed when U.S. warplanes dropped two 500-pound bombs on a house in which he met with other insurgency figures. Four years later, an Iraqi-American operation unleashed a barrage on a building in Tikrit, Iraq, killing the group\u2019s top two leaders and ushering in the tenure of an unknown figure named Baghdadi.\n\nNot surprisingly, those killings made Baghdadi risk-averse and even more inclined than other militant leaders to a life inhabited in the shadows. But while the leader\u2019s aversion to the public eye has protected Baghdadi, it has also allowed facts to melt into Islamic State propaganda, forging an identity that has become one of the most potent recruiting devices at the Islamic State\u2019s disposal.\n\nThe pitch: Baghdadi is a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, holds a doctorate in Islamic studies and envisions a Sunni-dominated caliphate that spans continents. It\u2019s a carefully crafted story that separates the Islamic State from nearly every other Islamic militant movement \u2014 evidenced when fighters of the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda offshoot battling in Syria, wanted to defect to the Islamic State. All they had to do, reported the New York Times, was make a few phone calls, pledge allegiance to Baghdadi and their new life would begin.\n\nThe mystique of Baghdadi, experts suggest, would make him all the more difficult to replace and his loss all the more significant. \u201cThe wounding and potential loss of Baghdadi may be of more significance for his followers\u201d than adherents of other jihadist groups, wrote Theodore Karasik, senior adviser to the company, Risk Insurance Management: \u201cBaghdadi, as \u2018Caliph Ibrahim,\u2019 to maintain his religious foundation, needs to be of a whole body. If he loses a limb in his injuries, his credibility suffers. If he dies, the death would toss the entire concept of the legitimacy of the \u2018Caliphate\u2019 on its head.\u201d\n\nUsing another name for the Islamic State, Karasik added: \u201cISIS discourse will likely need to be revised.\u201d\n\nSo if Baghdadi survived the American bombardment, he may retreat further into darkness. That\u2019s where he\u2019s most comfortable operating, reported the Soufan Group: \u201cHe is intensely careful about his security \u2026 when commanders below the leadership level were called to meet him, it is said that they would be told he was present in the group but without his identity being specified.\u201d Other reports said he wears masks when meeting prisoners to obscure his identity, earning the nickname of the \u201cinvisible sheik.\u201d\n\nWhen Baghdadi delivered a sermon from a mosque in Mosul on July 4, 2014, it marked the first time many people had gotten a good look at him. Before that appearance, there had only been two confirmed pictures him. And such \u201cobscurity,\u201d a Soufan report said, \u201cmay have provided [him] an advantage.\u201d\n\nIndeed, tracking his movements has been difficult in the black hole of Syria, where U.S. officials fumble around without a stable of contacts and intelligence services available in Iraq, according to a Foreign Policy report. \u201cThe same thing is needed to hunt down Baghdadi,\u201d Thomas Sanderson, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the magazine. \u201cWhen you kill the leader, it demonstrates that anyone is vulnerable.\u201d\n\nMaking the challenge more difficult: The Islamic State has altered its tactics. U.S. airstrikes have forced it hide its fighters among local communities and cities, Foreign Policy said, and stop moving its soldiers in large convoys. \u201cThey have gone to ground inside cities and this makes decapitation strikes very difficult,\u201d David E. Johnson, a Rand military expert, said. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill them if you can\u2019t find them.\u201d\n\nAnd few are more difficult to find than Baghdadi.","It looks like Apple's 12.9-inch iPad has been delayed.\n\nThe heavily rumored large-screen iPad, sometimes referred to as an \"iPad Pro,\" was initially reported to be launching in the first quarter of 2015.\n\nA new report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via Apple Insider) says Apple has faced delays on its 12.9-inch iPad, which will push the launch into the second quarter of 2015.\n\nIt's important to note that Kuo has a stellar track record when it comes to Apple, which means this is likely more than just a rumor.\n\nThe tablet's delay reportedly stems from the type of display that Apple intends to use in the tablet, which will utilize newer LCD technologies for faster response times and higher color saturation, according to Kuo.\n\nCiting a \"time crunch on component production and assembly,\" Kuo believes the iPad Pro won't enter mass production until the second quarter of 2015, months later than Apple's original plans.","Syrian press center, said the organization \u00abDaash\u00bb announced that the Egyptians called \u00abAbu Obeida\u00bb, Prince Zakat Chamber organization managed to escape after collecting zakat of capital in the fields east of the city of Deir ez-Zor, Syria.\n\nThe center said that \u00abthe amount stolen by Prince estimated billion Syrian pounds, was scheduled to reach the poor in the state of goodness\u00bb, as alleged by the organization.\n\nCommented on escape status \u00abAbu Obeida\u00bb, saying: \u00abPerhaps it is not the first time that escapes the leading figures of the organization, where he escaped from lawful period for the organization in the city, as well as one of the judges of the organization of Saudi citizenship\u00bb.","The tradition to stop stigma about the 'lobison' has continued for a century\n\nThe President of Argentina has adopted a young Jewish man as her godson to stop him turning into a werewolf.\n\nPresident Christina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner met Yair Tawil and his family at her office last week to mark the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years.\n\nAccording to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared \u201cel lobison\u201d.\n\nThe werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy\u2019s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.\n\nYo no lo sab\u00eda, pero su visita coincid\u00eda con la celebraci\u00f3n de Hanukkah.

The pair figured their bizarre California version of Lenin\u2019s Tomb would draw huge crowds and make big money.\n\nBut Manson, 80, does not want to marry Burton and has no interest in spending eternity displayed in a glass coffin, Simone told The Post. \u201cHe\u2019s finally realized that he\u2019s been played for a fool,\u201d Simone said.\n\nAnother reason the madman balked at the plan is because he believes he is immortal. \u201cHe feels he will never die,\u201d Simone said. \u201cTherefore, he feels it\u2019s a stupid idea to begin with.\u201d\n\nManson\u2019s and Burton\u2019s marriage license expired Thursday. \u201cThey plan on renewing the license, and things will move forward in the coming months,\u201d says a statement posted on Burton\u2019s and Hammond\u2019s website.\n\nBurton and Hammond \u2014 who uses the nickname Gray Wolf \u2014 could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe wedding was postponed \u201cdue to an unexpected interruption in logistics,\u201d the site says. Manson entered a prison medical facility for treatment of an infection about two months ago and cannot receive visitors, Simone said.\n\nCalifornia prison officials would not comment on either Manson\u2019s medical condition or his whereabouts.\n\nSimone and a collaborator, Heidi Jordan Ley, are seeking a publisher for their book, \u201cThe Retrial of Charles Manson.\u201d Manson and other inmates at Corcoran State Prison in California are helping the project. The authors say they spoke with Manson regularly before his phone privileges were suspended two years ago. They also corresponded with Manson and his inmate friends by mail.\n\nAccording to the authors, Burton and Hammond hatched their plan to display Manson\u2019s corpse about two years ago.\n\nInitially, the duo asked Manson to sign a document that would let them take his body when he dies.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give them a yes, he didn\u2019t give them a no.

Stringing them along kept the goodies coming, Simone said.\n\nWhen it became clear last year that the purportedly death-proof Manson would not green-light the plan, Burton and Hammond switched to the marriage idea, Simone says.\n\nIf Burton married Manson, the pair realized, California law would give her possession of Manson\u2019s remains upon his death, Simone said.\n\nSimone believes Manson never intended to marry Burton. \u201cManson never consented to the wedding in the first place and never will,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother Simone book, \u201cThe Lufthansa Heist,\u201d about a $6 million armed robbery at Kennedy Airport in 1978, is due out next month.

Flight 567, which originated in Los Cabos, Mexico, was taxiing for takeoff on Saturday at Los Angeles International Airport when the woman was stung, airline spokesman Cole Cosgrove said. The plane returned to the gate, where medics treated the woman and offered additional medical treatment, which she declined, Cosgrove said. She did not get back on the plane, he said. Passengers stayed on board, he said. The woman brushed the scorpion away after the sting and killed it on the floor with her foot, Cosgrove said. The crew of the Boeing 737 checked for other scorpions and the plane departed about 50 minutes late, he said. \"We don't know exactly how the scorpion made it on the plane, but the flight did originate in Los Cabos, Mexico, where scorpions are known to live,\" Cosgrove said. The airline was reaching out to the woman on Sunday regarding possible compensation for her inconvenience and to check on her condition, Cosgrove said. Only about 30 of about 1,500 species of scorpions can cause potentially fatal stings, according the website of the Mayo Clinic. \"Scorpion stings, although painful, are mostly harmless,\" a clinic posting said.

For instance, in addition to the routine boarding announcements at the Kingdom\u2019s airports, a prayer or verse from the Quran is read prior to take off. Furthermore, international flights usually have a specially designated men\u2019s prayer area to accommodate 5 daily prayers. In addition, the airline does not offer any beverages or dishes which contain alcohol or pork products. And the onboard entertainment menu does not offer any movies with adult content.\n\n\nThe Kingdom itself is infamous for gender segregation in everyday matters of society. For instance, women typically require male guardian approval to travel or work outside of the home. Saudi women are also not employed as stewardesses on Saudi Arabia\u2019s national carrier. That role is reserved for women of other nationalities.\n\nIronically enough, Israel too is battling the same problem, as many ultra-orthodox Jews refuse to share their transit time with female companions. A flight from New York to Tel Aviv was delayed by half an hour in late December after a group of male Jewish passengers onboard a Delta flight refused to sit next to women.\n\n\nIn October, on the eve of the Jewish festival Rosh Hashana, ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) men left the plane before take-off, also between New York and Tel Aviv, again refusing to sit next to women. In an incident in September, Israeli carrier El Al flight was postponed by 11-hours after a group of Haredi passengers refused to sit next to women.\n\nREAD MORE: Israeli airline criticized over Orthodox Jews \u2018bullying\u2019 women passengers\n\nLast September an Israeli campaign, seeking to put a stop to the segregation stalemate started an online campaign on Change.org, entitled, \"Ultra-Orthodox passengers refuse to sit next to women on El Al flights\"\n\n\"Why does El Al Airlines permit female passengers to be bullied, harassed, and intimidated into switching seats which they rightfully paid for and were assigned to by El Al Airlines?

The German chancellor grumbled at being asked to play games and take tests with the Prime Minister, US and Chinese presidents around a table with dozens of heads of state at a nuclear summit in The Hague. Her complaints were overruled because Mr Obama was keen on the idea and in on the surprise.\u201d\n\nOf equal concern to the Kremlin, this report continues, are that these events are occurring as predicted by former US Assistant Treasury Secretary Dr. Paul Craig Roberts who this past June warned that Obama regime was planning for a preemptive nuclear attack.\n\nIn his warning Dr. Roberts stated: \u201cWashington not only has war plans for launching a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia, and also possibly China, but Washington has a cadre of people who advocate nuclear war. We have people running around Washington saying things such as \u2018What\u2019s the good of nuclear weapons if you can\u2019t use them.\u201d\n\nWith the \u201csuicidal tendencies\u201d of the Obama regime becoming more apparent by the day, the SVR in this report grimly concludes, Russia\u2019s near record de-Dollarization efforts, when coupled with the \u201csecret deal\u201d between the US and Saudi Arabia to destroy Syria, point towards a truly tragic global outcome as the American-backed Western economy is near collapse\u2026and all who oppose them will surely suffer their wrath\u2026.including the 1.2 million of their own citizens they currently have under surveillance and targeted for destruction.\n\nOctober 12, 2014 \u00a9 EU and US all rights reserved.

Check. A strange and amazing turn of events? Check. Justin Bieber angle when he\u2019s already in the news for a run-in with Orlando Bloom? Check.\n\nToo good to check? Check.\n\nBut next thing you know, NPR\u2019s \u201cMorning Edition\u201d covers it, and it ends up in a Seth Meyers monologue:\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: the first story of the bear attack was published in Russian language publication Pravda back on July 31 \u2014 and it says nothing about Justin Bieber.\n\nAt some point in making the leap to English, someone added a detail to the story that transformed it into a viral hit. According to Google Translate, the original Russian version said the bear was scared away when Igor Vorozhbitsyn\u2019s phone began speaking out the current time. So, yes, the phone apparently scared off the bear mid-mauling. But no Bieber.\n\nDid Vorozhbitsyn change his story in a subsequent interview and realize it was Bieber all along?\n\nOr did someone insert a seemingly false Justin Bieber angle into the story?\n\nPoint of Bieberfication\n\nThe bear-and-Bieber stories all carried the same pictures of Vorozhbitsyn. They had the same quotes of him explaining that his granddaughter had put the ringtone on his phone.\n\nThey quote the same \u201cwildlife expert\u201d: \u201cSometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear.\u201d\n\nHey, thanks for that too-perfect quote to round out the story, anonymous wildlife expert with no credentials!\n\nThe symmetry in the stories is because they all used the information contained in a single English language report from a site called the Austrian Times. It\u2019s led by a Brit named Michael Leidig, who also owns the Central European News agency. (His name is listed in the domain owership records for the sites, as well as for CEN\u2019s affiliate agency, EuroPics.)\n\nAfter the Austrian Times/CEN published the story, it spread to MailOnline.\n\nOnce MailOnline had it, the story was off and running. Bieber and the bear was the real deal, and everyone wanted to plant a flag on it. As of this writing, MailOnline\u2019s story has racked up over 13,000 shares.\n\nThe images are the first clue as to where the story really came from. MailOnline cited CEN as the copyright holder of the image it used. But the Austrian Times story credits Pravda with the image on its story. A search on the Pravda website turned up the original article with its images and Bieber-less reporting.\n\nSo how did the Austrian Times learn of the Bieber angle that Pravda apparently missed?\n\nNo answer from Austrian Times/CEN/EuroPics\n\nI called the offices of the Austrian Times and first asked to speak with David Rogers, who is the only person listed on the site. (He is both its ombudsman and its primary sales contact.)\n\nI spoke with a woman who said Rogers was not in the office. When I asked about the story, she said she would follow up with their office in Russia to get the details and would call me back. I asked if their office there typically rewrites things from wires and local press.\n\n\u201cA lot of stories are found on the wire or in local media but also from local interviews on the ground, or we speak to the reporters who wrote them; we speak to police to get things confirmed,\u201d she said.\n\nI called her again later that day to ask if she had news from the Russian office, and she said they are often hard to get ahold of. She never got back to me.\n\nI also called and emailed Leidig, owner of both the Austrian Times, CEN and EuroPics. A man who answered the phone at the CEN office said Leidig is on vacation in Romania.\n\nLeidig, who has lived in Austria for some time, says nothing about himself on the CEN or Times websites, but he has an extensive Wikipedia page. In the section about CEN, it lists MailOnline as one of its clients, though that and much of the page itself offers no citation for the claim. (In 2013, Leidig self-published a book about Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff.)\n\nAlong with detailing Leidig\u2019s journalistic achievements, the Wikipedia page includes this passage:\n\nLeidig is also a campaigner for greater support for journalism which he describes as the \u201ccoalface of democracy.\u201d He has campaigned in favour of more responsibility from search engines like Google to give credit to original source material and also for payment for originators of news, arguing that if the journalists all go out of business nobody will provide the content worth having.\nThe sole link in that passage goes to\u2026 an article on the Austrian Times. Still, one would hope Pravda is therefore earning some revenue from the story and images that CEN and the Austrian Times plucked from its site. (I contacted Pravda to ask about the images and the story, but have not yet heard back.)\n\nFor their part, the Austrian Times, CEN and EuroPics have stopped talking to me. After receiving no information from their Russian bureau, I sent a detailed email Thursday with questions about the Bieber version of the Pravda story and its use \u2014 and possible resale \u2014 of Pravda images.  No has replied or returned my calls.\n\nMeanwhile, the irresistibly Bieberfied version of the story continues to spread. Entertainment websites and news organizations give it the quick rewrite treatment and link to each other\u2019s versions, completely obscuring the dubious origins of the story.\n\nToo good to check, and now, I suspect, too entrenched to ever be really corrected.","LOS ANGELES (CBS Seattle/AP) \u2014 A scorpion stung a woman on the hand just before her flight from Los Angeles to Portland took off.\nFlight 567 was taxiing on the runway Saturday night when the passenger was stung, Alaska Airlines spokesman Cole Cosgrove said. The plane returned to the gate, and the woman was checked by medics. She refused additional medical treatment, but she didn\u2019t get back on the plane.\nThe woman stomped the scorpion to death, and flight attendants checked overhead compartments for any additional unwanted arachnids, Cosgrove said. It\u2019s unclear how the scorpion got on the plane, but the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico, where scorpions are common, he said.\nThe flight then took off at 8:40 p.m., about an hour late.\nMembers of Oregon State University\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team were on the flight, Cosgrove said.  The team was returning home after losing to USC 68-55.\nOregon State Coach Wayne Tinkle told ESPN that the woman was sitting two rows in front of him.\n\u201cThe plane was coming from Mexico before us and the scorpion was on the plane,\u201d Tinkle said.  \u201cThe woman was a real champ.  She acted like it was a mosquito bite.

Needless to say, her parents aren\u2019t too thrilled about it.\n\n\u201cMy mom ran out the door. She won\u2019t talk to me. She won\u2019t let my sister talk to me,\u201d Tridevil said of her mother\u2019s reaction.

Previously obsessed with Criss Angel, she said she goes to Vegas alone every year for her birthday to see the dark magician. Last year, she bought tickets for the whole first row of seats for his show.\n\nWhich leads to one more obvious question. Where does a 21-year-old woman get the $20,000 for a procedure like a third boob? And with Criss Angel\u2019s Vegas tickets going for $59 to $130 right now, purchasing a full row doesn\u2019t come cheap. Tridevil said she\u2019s a licensed massage therapist and saved for two years for the $20,000 implant.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t spend any of that money,\u201d she said, which is inconsistent with her purchasing an entire row of Criss Angel tickets. But, hey. Whatever.\n\nMassage therapy isn\u2019t Tridevil\u2019s calling anymore. She\u2019s unhappy and ready to move on to the next step of her life: television.\n\nTridevil has already gotten her start on her YouTube channel featuring a riveting video about what\u2019s wrong with tewntysomethings and how to get a job.\n\n\u201cWhen I give you advice, I don\u2019t wanna hear you give me excuses,\u201d she said in the video.\n\nYou tell 'em girl.\n\n\u201cMy whole dream is to just get this show on MTV,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cI\u2019m dumping every penny I have into this,\u201d Tridevil said of the reality show she\u2019s currently producing. \u201cSo if this doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m through.\u201d\n\n[Buzzfeed]","It\u2019s enough to scare someone off of having children.\n\nWhether it\u2019s gluten or plastics or peanuts, it seems young and new parents have more and more social taboos to navigate.\n\nThe latest parenting taboo?

Their crime? Not informing the parents of his classmate their son would not be attending a birthday party in December.\n\n\n\nJulie Lawrence, the birthday boy\u2019s mother, has defended the \u201cfee\u201d as necessary to recoup the costs associated with a no-show. She said Alex told her son he would attend the party and took that as proper confirmation. She said the cost covers one ticket to the \u201cchild\u2019s party at the ski slope including snow tubing and tobogganing and lunch.\u201d\n\nLawrence has also threatened to take the Nash family to small claims court if they don\u2019t pay up.\n\nNash has said he understood the financial concerns and said it was the way Lawrence went about it that offended. They have also taken the issue up with the school, because it allowed Lawrence to place the brown envelope in Alex\u2019s backpack, which is against school policy.\n\nSo where was Alex? Out with his grandparents, whom he chose over the party when his parents realized he was double booked for the day and it was the only chance he would have to see them before Christmas.\n\nAlex\u2019s mom, Tanya Nash, explained this to Lawrence in a Facebook exchange printed by the Plymouth Herald, the local paper that first broke the story. The ensuing Facebook debate between the two mothers now has parents around the world chiming in.\n\n\nIf Lawrence\u2019s side of the story seems reasonable \u2014 she did have to pay for Alex when he didn\u2019t show up after all \u2014 the Facebook conversation takes quite the turn. The moms\u2019 fight about whether or not they had each other\u2019s number and who was ruder in how they approached the other parent.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time Alex has not turned up to a party that he has been invited to, either. the amicable way round this I believe would be to pay me the money and let a lesson be learnt, I hope this is agreeable,\u201d Lawrence writes.\n\nNash responds that she can\u2019t think of another party Alex missed where there was a formal invite, and the pushes back against Lawrence\u2019s tone: \u201cExactly what lesson would I be learning? I am not a child, so please do not speak to me like I am one. So, to answer your question, unfortunately no.

The myth predicts the child will transform into a creature at midnight during each full moon, eternally damned to ravage the countryside before returning to human form.\n\nOther fun bits of el lobison trivia, per The Independent: They feed on excrement, unbaptized babies and the flesh of the recently dead; they're unnaturally strong; and they can spread their curse by biting.\n\nThe fear of el lobison's curse was so strong in Argentina that families abandoned \u2013 or in some cases murdered \u2013 their seventh son in the 19th century, which is how the tradition of the sitting president adopting one of these children came to pass in 1907. It was formally decreed in 1973 by then-president Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n, and extended to baby girls at that time. Those adopted gain the sitting president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.\n\n\n\n\nThis year, Kirchner adopted the first Jewish seventh son, Yair Tawil. The practice had extended only to Catholic children until 2009. Kirchner met with Yair and his parents, Shlomo and Nehama, on Dec. 23. She called the family \"marvelous,\" described Yair as \"a total sweetie,\" and bestowed the presidential nickname of \"Queen Esther\" on Nehama.

Even though the addition of another breast is theoretically possible, it is not plausible.\n\n\"[I] believe 100 percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,\u201d Dr. Matthew Schulman, a board-certified plastic surgeon in New York, told the Daily Dot. \u201cI would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.\"\n\nThere are two main reasons the doctor is skeptical about Tridevil\u2019s story. The first is the photographic \u201cevidence\u201d of the third breast has been taken by Tridevil and posted on her personal Facebook page. The lighting is dim and the photos easily could have been altered, the Daily Dot wrote.\n\nSecond, creating a third breast would require placement of a tissue expander beneath the skin between her two breasts to make a pocket for the false breast. It would take about six months for this to happen and then the spacer could be replaced with an implant. Schulman said multiple surgeries would need be required.\n\nWhen asked about her surgery, Tridevil simply said she had it done a few months ago. She didn\u2019t mention anything about an expander or how long it took for the surgery.\n\nThe final bit of evidence that suggests Tridevil\u2019s third breast is fake was the final result. \u201cThis technique would create a tight, round breast in the center of the chest,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, all three breasts will likely be connected because it would be impossible to create and maintain separation between all three round structures. The photos show a soft, pendulous breast that is clearly separate from the right and left breast. She essentially has a hanging breast, and it is just not reflective of what we would be able to expect from this reconstruction procedure.\u201d\n\nDuring a radio interview, Tridevil refused to give her real name but Snopes pointed out she has a \u201cstriking\u201d resemblance to Alisha Hessler, the person to whom JASMINETRIDEVIL.com is registered.\n\nHessler made headlines in 2013 after she publicly shamed a man who allegedly assaulted her, Snopes wrote.

Steve Warren, went out to talk to the media yesterday without really knowing what had happened:\n\nThe Pentagon said the Marines destroyed heavy weapons in their embassy arsenal, including machine guns, before leaving for the airport but remained armed with smaller weapons until the end to ensure a safe exit from the country.\n\n\"The movement from the embassy to the aircraft required armed Marines,\" Army Colonel Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said at a briefing...\n\nAsked whether the Marines turned over their weapons to Houthi fighters, Warren said: \"It's unclear, frankly. We believe they turned them over to government officials at the airport, prior to boarding the aircraft.\"\n\n\"As everyone knows, weapons are generally not authorized on commercial aircraft,\" Warren said. He said the Marines were probably carrying handguns and assault rifles until their departure.\nSuch is the stuff that crazy conspiracy theories are made of. Warren's shaky answers certainly made the fate of the Marines' weapons worth investigating. It's unclear who Fox News' unnamed sources were, but they were so compelling that Kelly and her hawkish guests were shrieking about their implications at 9 p.m. last night... three hours after the Marine Corps had debunked the whole cruddy rumor, twice.\n\nFirst, they debunked it on background in a report by the independent Marine Corps Times just after 6 p.m.:\n\nThe Marine security detachment guarding the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen left no operational weapons behind as troops evacuated the country, a senior Marine official with knowledge of the movement told Marine Corps Times.\n\n...the Marine official, who asked that he not be identified because he was unauthorized to discuss the situation, said no working Marine weapons, whether crew-served or personal rifles and sidearms, were seized or handed over as the troops departed.\n\n\"No Marines handed over a functional weapon to anybody,\" the official said.\nThen, the Marines debunked it on the record, with minute details on how their weapons were scuttled so as to be useless, on their own website:\n\n\nCLARITY ON MARINE SECURITY FORCE DEPARTURE FROM YEMEN\n\nFebruary / 11 / 2015\n\nHEADQUARTERS MARINE CORPS, WASHINGTON \u2014 The Marine Security Force left the American embassy in Yemen for the movement to the airfield as part of the \"ordered departure\" with only personal weapons. All crew served weapons were destroyed at the embassy prior to movement. None of them were 'handed over' in any way to anyone. The destruction of weapons at the embassy and the airport was carried out in accordance with an approved destruction plan.\n\nUpon arrival at the airfield, all personal weapons were rendered inoperable in accordance with advance planning. Specifically, each bolt was removed from its weapons body and rendered inoperable by smashing with sledgehammers. The weapons bodies, minus the bolts, were then separately smashed with sledgehammers. All of these destroyed components were left at the airport \u2014 and components were scattered; no usable weapon was taken from any Marine at Sana'a airport.\n\nTo be clear: No Marine handed a weapon to a Houthi, or had one taken from him.\n\nOffice of U.S. Marine Corps Communication\nPhone: 703-614-4309\nOntherecord@USMC.MIL\nSo how come Kelly was letting her Fox News guests hold forth on a debunked rumor, three hours later? \"We're surrendering our embassy,\" Hegseth told her. \"And now we're asking U.S. Marines to surrender their dignity, give up oaths they made, creeds that they lived by, and surrender their rifle.\" Retired Gen. Jack Keane added: \"This is a mindless stupid bureaucrat making a decision like that offensive to military culture, offensive to procedures.\"\n\nIt's probably helpful to know a little bit of background about those guests. Hegseth, who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for Senate in Minnesota awhile back, is an ex-Bear Stearns banker whose way through Princeton was paid in part by the conservative Family Research Council. Since 2008, he's made six figures chairing astroturfed veterans' groups for GOP causes, and has been a seven-figure bag man for political donations from Republican billionaire Sheldon Adelson. He's on call whenever Republicans need a military vet to blast liberals, even though his own track record of strategic prognostications includes this gem: \"eliminating Saddam and liberating Iraq could be the 'Normandy Invasion' or 'fall of the Berlin Wall' of our generation\u2026 and there is equally encouraging evidence that republican principles could thrive there.\"\n\nKeane, for his part, cofounded and chaired a neoconservative propaganda front, the Institute for the Study of War, with some of Dick Cheney's top geopolitical advisors, using it to rally support for the \" troop surge\" in Iraq. Since leaving the service in 2003, he's been a paid consultant for military contractors, including the company formerly known as Blackwater. He's never met a costly military engagement he couldn't make costlier.\n\nConfronted with a combined force like this, the Marine Corps didn't stand a chance.\n\n[Photo credit: Cpl. Christopher A. Green/U.S. Marine Corps]","What began as an Occupy-inspired student sit-in exploded in Hong Kong over the weekend as police responded with excessive force toward peaceful demonstrators, using tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets. The Occupy Central protests spread from Hong Kong\u2019s financial district to just outside the city\u2019s government offices in Admiralty, but the law-enforcement crackdown had the opposite effect, sending thousands more into the streets in solidarity and shutting down portions of the city. The protests have now bled into the work week and riot police have pulled back, at least for now. Here\u2019s what you need to know so far.\n\nWhat started this?\n\nAfter 150 years of British rule, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997, but has operated semi-autonomously under what\u2019s known as \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d outside of Beijing\u2019s communist rule. The promise was that in 2017, Hong Kong would be allowed, for the first time, to elect its own leader (known as chief executive) in democratic elections, instead of having the slot filled by a committee from Beijing. But earlier this summer, China decided a committee was still necessary, and it would select the candidates for Hong Kong\u2019s 2017 elections. Outrage has been building ever since.\n\nWho\u2019s out there?\n\nThe protests were organized in part by the Hong Kong Federation of Students, which has since called for an indefinite student strike, the New York Times reports. Young people are everywhere, but not alone. The Hong Kong Professional Teachers\u2019 Union has joined them with a general strike, as have some professionals after the weekend violence \u2014 \u201coffice workers in slacks and dress shirts mixed with crowds of students in black T-shirts,\u201d according to the Times.\n\nOccupy Central with Love and Peace, meanwhile, is led by a University of Hong Kong law professor named Benny Tai, Businessweek reported earlier this summer. Tai has been organizing for months, and a look at his planning from June now serves as some serious foreshadowing:\n\nAt some point, Tai says the movement may follow through on the threat in its name and occupy Central, where most of Hong Kong\u2019s top banks and other financial institutions (as well as Bloomberg) have their offices. Many companies are already taking no chances, developing plans in case demonstrators block the streets and prevent employees from getting to work.\n\nWhat do they want?\n\nIn addition to democratic elections in 2017 and continued autonomy for Hong Kong, as previously promised, protesters are now demanding the resignation of current chief executive Leung Chun-ying. The economics are also less than ideal, and the country could be slipping into a recession.\n\nHow is the government reacting?\n\nNot well, especially at first. Here\u2019s a video from the ground of protesters being teargassed, in attacks that look familiar from Ferguson and helped stoke outrage among citizens:\n\nThe use of pepper spray has been equally alarming, and is reminiscent of previous Occupy protests in the U.S.\n\nHong Kong police officer grabs elderly protester, turns and pepper sprays them full in the face: http://t.co/5l0pFtGGTF\n\nAs Vox notes, some protesters have taken to using the \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d imagery of the Michael Brown demonstrations in Ferguson. It\u2019s still a powerful image on the other side of the world:\n\n.@attorneycrump Will you please show this to #MikeBrown's parents &amp;let them know that he changed the WORLD! #HongKong pic.twitter.com/3u4FOSnp7x\n\nProtesters in Ferguson have sent a message back:\n\nHeather, a #Ferguson protester, wearing a sign that says \"Stay strong #HongKong.\" pic.twitter.com/9CnqFfERfL\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising, then, that Beijing is blaming the West for stoking tensions. From the Times:\n\nA commentary on the website of the People\u2019s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s main newspaper, claimed that the upheavals in Hong Kong were instigated by democratic radicals who had sought support from \u201canti-China forces\u201d in Britain and the United States, and had sought lessons from independence activists in Taiwan. It called them a \u201cgang of people whose hearts belong to colonial rule and who are besotted with \u2018Western democracy\u2019.\u201d\n\nHong Kong has canceled its annual fireworks celebration of China\u2019s National Day on Wednesday, indicating that this thing may continue for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cThe protesters, they are so young,\u201d a mother of two who joined the protests on Monday told the Times. \u201cThey are fighting for our future, for my children\u2019s future.\u201d","Saudi Arabia has announced that it has the right to cover women\u2019s eyes\u2014\u2018especially the tempting ones.\u2019\n\n\u201cI love the looks of you, the lure of you\n\nThe sweet of you, and the pure of you\n\nThe eyes, the arms, and the mouth of you\n\nThe east, west, north, and the south of you\u201d\n\n\u2014Cole Porter\n\nIt\u2019s a safe bet that Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of Saudi Arabia\u2019s religious police, isn\u2019t a fan of Cole Porter. \u201cThe lure of you\u201d is precisely why Nabet announced yesterday that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice will cover any women\u2019s eyes that are deemed \u201ctempting.\u201d \u201cThe men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones\u201d he said. \u201c[We] have the right to do so.\u201d\n\nWhat are \u201ctempting\u201d eyes? One Saudi journalist mused on condition of anonymity that they are \u201cuncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble.\u201d The Orwellian-named committee did not provide a definition of tempting, but if they happen to rely on Merriam-Webster, then it means \u201chaving an appeal.\u201d What is an appeal? According to the dictionary, it is \u201carousing a sympathetic response.\u201d And what is sympathetic? \u201cShowing empathy,\u201d according to Merriam-Webster.\n\nSo there you have it. To allow a women\u2019s eyes to capture the unfettered glory of the world, one must empathize with her very existence. But the religious police\u2014massively funded by King Abdullah\u2014cannot do this. \u201cIt\u2019s so stupid,\u201d the Saudi journalist tells me. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won\u2019t be silent.\u201d\n\nPerhaps they won\u2019t be, but the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has some of the most powerful backers in the country. Prince Naif, recently appointed heir to the throne, has said: \u201cThe committee is supported by all sides ... It should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee.\u201d No surprise, then, that King Abdullah awarded this draconian body an additional 200 million riyals (about $53 million) in March.\n\nHow should America respond to this latest affront to Saudi women? Perhaps it can sponsor a contest of the most tempting eyes in Saudi Arabia. Women will send in pictures of their most tempting look and the winner will get to accompany President Obama during his next meeting with the Saudi dictator.\n\nIf Congress reconsidered the recent $60 billion U.S.-Saudi arms deal, the religious police might quickly find it \u201ctempting\u201d to stop treating women as property.","Jabhat al-Nusra and Isis leaders are reportedly meeting to co-ordinate attacks\n\nIsis fighters are reportedly just one mile away from Baghdad as reports emerge of al-Qaeda militants bolstering their ranks in Syria.\n\nAccording to the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East, Isis was approaching the Iraqi capital on Monday morning.\n\n\"The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"They said it could never happen and now it almost has. Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be here a very short while to know they can do very very little.\"\n\nIsis fighters were also battling Government forces in a key town 25 miles west of Baghdad - Amiriyat al-Fallujah.\n\nAccording to a BBC correspondent, fighting had calmed by Monday afternoon but a standoff continued along the main road to nearby Fallujah, which is under Isis control.\n\nThe extremists had been advancing towards the capital but were held off by bombing and Iraqi ground forces.\n\nUS air strikes overnight targeted other Isis positions in Anbar province, the Pentagon said, and in Syria four more oil fields controlled by militants near Raqqa were hit on Sunday.\n\nAmerican officials called the attacks \u201csuccessful\u201d but the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed mostly civilians were hit and a grain silo was destroyed.\n\nThe news comes amid reports of an emerging alliance between Isis forces in Syria and Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the Nusra Front.\n\nThe group is the Syrian offshoot of al-Qaeda and has been fighting against the Assad regime in the civil war.\n\nDespite months of clashes between its forces and Isis (also known as Islamic State) militants, the two groups appear to be forming a loose coalition in parts of the country to fight increasing attacks by the US and its allies.\n\nAl-Nusra\u2019s official spokesperson, Abu Firas al-Suri, threatened the coalition nations with retaliation on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThese states have committed a horrible act that is going to put them on the list of jihadist targets throughout the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is not a war against al-Nusra, but a war against Islam.\u201d\n\nAl-Nusra and Isis leaders are now holding war planning meetings together, a source told the Guardian, although no formal alliance has been confirmed.\n\nThe reports follow growing defections from other Islamist groups to Isis, which is seen as better organised and equipped to create an \u201cIslamic State\u201d straddling Iraq and Syria.\n\nA loyalty pledge was reportedly made by al-Nusra in June in the town of Al-Bukamal near the Iraqi border, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, and the two groups have fought together against Government forces.\n\nThe report appeared to be confirmed on Twitter by a photograph showing an Egyptian al-Nusra Front commander shaking hands with an Isis leader of Chechen origin.\n\nAlthough both Isis and al-Nusra are rooted in al-Qaeda, the two have been rivals since Isis started its involvement in Syria\u2019s civil war in spring last year and have engaged in bloody battles killing more than 3,000 militants from both sides.\n\nA merger had been declared by Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2013, when Isis was known as al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), but the alliance was rejected by al-Nusra and overruled by al-Qaeda leader al-Zawahiri.\n\nBut the international response to Isis\u2019 bloody rampage through Iraq and Syria, and the beheadings of British and American hostages, is pushing the groups towards an alliance.\n\nAn al-Nusra source told Reuters: \u201cThere are hardline voices inside Nusra who are pushing for reconciliation with Islamic State.\u201d\n\nA formal alliance is believed to only be possible on the orders of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.\n\nA deal between the militant groups would strengthen the Islamist force in Syria as air strikes cripple Isis funding sources, equipment stores and slow its advances.\n\nThe US has not said al-Nusra is being targeted but its planes have attacked a new group called Khorasan, which some analysts suspect is part of al-Nusra.\n\nThe two groups have been known to co-operate and Khorasan is believed to be made up of veteran al-Qaeda fighters with battlefield experience mostly in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nBritain, the US and the United Nations are among those who have classed al-Nusra as a terrorist group, citing its use of suicide bombing, terrorist attacks and attempts to impose Islamic law.\n\nA small number of anti-Government groups, including some members for the secular Free Syrian Army, opposed the label after al-Nusra gained respect fighting the Assad regime.","Late comedian's personal physician allegedly performed an unauthorized biopsy, causing a heart attack\n\nJoan Rivers' personal doctor took a selfie in the

Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor, who has not been publicly identified, took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia,\" an unnamed source close to the

The blog's Josh Constine says that he's confirmed the news with five sources at both Apple and Beats. And to be honest, it makes sense.\n\nIt seems very unlikely that Apple is going to abandon streaming music altogether. If true, news that Beats Music is dying reads as a clear indication that Apple is going to create its own streaming service or simply expand iTunes Radio. Constine agrees:\n\nConsidering Apple's penchant for simple, unified brands, and how it despises fragmentation, shutting down Beats Music makes a lot of sense. Running a second music service in parallel with iTunes that forces people to learn a whole new interface might have confused customers. Beats Music's CEO Ian Rogers was also put in charge of iTunes Radio, meaning he's already splitting his time rather than just focusing on Beats Music.\n\nBased on images of the home screen, Constine adds, it looks like Apple's readying a new music app just for the new Apple Watch. People thought the company's music app for wearables would be Beats Music. And maybe it sort of is on the back end! It just won't be called Beats Music.\n\nRead the full report at TechCrunch.","Hewlett-Packard confirmed on Monday that it will split the company into two new corporations, one focused on PCs and printers and the other on its enterprise businesses.\n\nNews of the split was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.

Path's platform will probably survive the acquisition and somehow be incorporated into Apple's revamped Messages app, according to the article.

Due to religious and modesty regulations, the airline plans to \u201cenforce\u201d separation, according to a spokesman for the company.\n\nThe airline in question is Saudi Arabia\u2019s national airline, Saudia as reported on the RT website. Saudia wants to separate male and female air travellers, mainly due to complaints from husbands who don\u2019t like unknown men sitting next to their wives.\n\nSaudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd told reporters, \u201cThere are solutions to this problem\u2026we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.\u201d\n\nAs such, the airline hopes to begin arranging for check-in staff at the airport to assign separate seating for their passengers, unless they are closely related.\n\nAs widely reported, it isn\u2019t just Muslims who have these modesty issues as Orthodox Jews also have similar laws calling for the separation of men and women in public.\n\nBack in September, an El AL flight from New York to Israel\u2019s Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport was delayed because some orthodox male flyers refused to sit next to women.\n\nBut while these religious practices are all fine for some people, they are not suitable for others, and certainly not on a public place like an airplane, where flight crews are constantly working against the clock to ensure their aircraft takes off on time.\n\nIt terms of the FAA\u2019s rules for this type of crew disruption, Federal Aviation Regulations 91.11, 121.580 and 135.120 state that \u201cno person may assault, threaten, intimidate, or interfere with a crewmember in the performance of the crewmember\u2019s duties aboard an aircraft being operated.\u201d\n\nIt therefore remains to be seen what course of action will be taken by Saudia airlines, and if plans to separate people based on gender is even legal, not to mention the logistical and ethical nightmare.","If there\u2019s one thing Apple currently lacks, it\u2019s a good social layer to their various offerings.

They\u2019ve been widely lauded as a heavy-hitter when it comes to UI and experience, something Apple covets in their own right.\nFurther evidence of this comes with news that Dave Morin \u2014 current Path CEO and former Apple employee \u2014 was spotted sitting front and center at Apple\u2019s iPhone 6/Apple Watch event yesterday. That\u2019s a spot typically reserved for top brass and partners, not the CEO if a hit-and-miss social platform Apple has no involvement in.\n\nApple snapping up Path is also said to be more than an acquihire to get folks like Morin back in the fold. Pando\u2019s source says Path will survive the acquisition whole, and be cobbled (somehow, maybe lightly) into Apple\u2019s revamped Messaging app.\n\nIt seems a likely acquisition, and it will be interesting to see how Apple works Path into their fold. Path is good, but suffers the same \u201cghost town\u201d moniker that haunts other social platforms like Google+. But hey, at least it will probably work out better than Apple\u2019s previous social experiment, right?\n\nRight?\n\nSource: Pando Daily","Saudi Arabia's national airline is allegedly planning to separate male and female passengers on its flights, in accordance to strict rules enforced by the Gulf kingdom.\n\nGulf media report that Saudia will keep men and women segregated onboard, unless they are close relatives.\n\nThe move follows a spate of complaints from male fliers unwilling to allow other males to sit next to their wives and other female family members.\n\nNational carrrier Saudia will keep men and women segregated onboard, unless they are close relatives\n\nComplaints were also recently made when male passengers claimed a flight attendant was being too 'flirty'.\n\n'There are solutions to this problem\u2026we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,' Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, told Saudi daily, Ajel.\n\nIt is thought that the airline will include instructions to flight booking staff at Gulf airports to keep these new rules in place.\n\nThe carrier's policies are already in tune to the strict Islamic practices of Saudi Arabia: no alcoholic beverages or pork dishes are served onboard, a prayer of verse from the Quran is read before take off, and many international flights have a designated men's prayer area.\n\nIn addition, Saudia does not employ Saudi women as cabin crew, opting to recruit women from other countries such as Pakistan, the Philippines, Albania and Bosnia instead.\n\nBut moves are being made to employ females on the ground in November, the airline opened its fourth women's section staffed by entirely by females at its office in the Murooj district of Saudi capital, Riyadh.\n\nThere are no alcoholic beverages or pork dishes are served on board.\n\nA prayer of verse from the Quran is read before take off, and many international flights have a designated men's prayer area.\n\nThe airline does not employ Saudi women as cabin crew, opting to recruit women from other countries such as Pakistan, the Philippines, Albania and Bosnia instead.\n\nThe national airline's policies are already in tune to the strict Islamic practices of Saudi Arabia.

(CBS St. Louis/AP) \u2014 A pregnant woman lost her eye during protests in Ferguson early Tuesday morning after a St. Louis County Police officer fired a bean bag round at the car she was in, shattering the glass on the passenger-side window.\nDornella Conner told KMOV-TV that she and her boyfriend, De\u2019Angelas Lee, were at a gas station early Tuesday morning during the protests following a grand jury decision not to indict Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson in the Aug. 9 shooting death of Michael Brown. Conners claims that they were trying to drive around the officers\u2019 cars, but they blocked them in.\n\u201cThey pulled up while we were coming towards the street. De\u2019Angelas was trying to get away. They blocked us from the side, front and back,\u201d Conners told KMOV.\nPolice, though, tell the station that Lee was driving his car toward them and that\u2019s when an officer fired a bean bag round at the car, which shattered the passenger-side glass where Conner was sitting.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any weapons. I wasn\u2019t looting or anything. I was just out with my boyfriend and we were just riding around and respecting Mike Brown,\u201d Conners said.\nConner sought medical attention from another police officer before she was taken to a hospital. The shattered glass left her blind in her left eye.\n\u201cI\u2019m very upset and very disappointed with tactics that they used on trying to get control of the situation that was going,\u201d Donnell Conner, Dornella\u2019s father, told KMOV. \u201cI understand it\u2019s a tough job, I understand that it was chaos, but there was no reason to fire upon an innocent person that\u2019s sitting in a vehicle.\n\u201cHow can a pregnant person in a car in a seatbelt be causing chaos?\u201d\nDornella Conner took to Facebook to thank her family and friends for their support.\n\u201c[I\u2019m] blind in my left eye and they took it out because I got shot in my face so I can only see in my right eye, but thank God that i can see the world and still alive,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m in a lot of pain but I\u2019m ok.\u201d\nKMOV reports that an arrest warrant has been issued for Lee and a bond has been set at $50,000. Sixteen people were arrested on the gas station lot located on the 10000 block of Halls Ferry Road on Tuesday.\nDespite the violence this week, protesters in Ferguson pressed pause Thursday as the city welcomed Thanksgiving, decorating boarded-up storefronts with some Dr. Seuss inspiration and gathering for church services \u2014 a stark contrast to previous days of outrage over the grand jury decision in the Michael Brown case.\nNo police officers or Missouri National Guard members stood sentry outside the Ferguson police station, which has been a nexus for protesters since Monday night\u2019s announcement,\nOn that downtown street, beneath a lighted \u201cSeason\u2019s Greetings\u201d garland, three children used paintbrushes to decorate the plywood covering many storefront windows that was put up to foil potential vandals. One quoted from \u201cThe Lorax\u201d by Dr. Seuss: \u201cUnless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better, it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\u201cWe thought we\u2019d do what we could to make it a little more attractive and then try to bring the kids into it and get them involved in making the businesses appear a little less scary, depressing,\u201d said Leah Bailey, as her 7-year-old son Dennis climbed a ladder to finish an orange dragon.\nSeveral hours after dark, a few people continued painting, but there was no visible protest activity. National Guard troops occasionally patrolled the area and surrounding neighborhoods in vehicles and on foot.\nSince the grand jury\u2019s decision, protests have taken place across the country. Most have been peaceful. But at least 130 demonstrators who refused to disperse during a Los Angeles protest were arrested Wednesday night, while 35 people were detained in Oakland following a march that deteriorated into unrest and vandalism, according to police officials.\nBack in Ferguson, Greater St. Mark Family Church sits blocks from where several stores went up in flames after the grand jury announcement. A handful of people listened to the Rev. Tommie Pierson preach Thursday that the destruction and chaos was by \u201ca small group of out-of-control people out there.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t represent the community, they don\u2019t represent the mood nor the feelings of the community,\u201d Pierson said. \u201cI would imagine if you talked to them, they probably don\u2019t even live here. So, we don\u2019t want to be defined by what they did.\u201d\nIn downtown St. Louis, a group gathered near Busch Stadium for what organizer Paul Byrd called a \u201cpro-community\u201d car rally meant to be peaceful and counter the recent Ferguson violence he suggested has tarnished the region\u2019s image.\nByrd, a 45-year-old construction worker from Imperial, Missouri, declined to say whether he supported Wilson but noted, \u201cI totally support police officers.\u201d The cruise was escorted by a city police vehicle; no protesters showed up.\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

About 40 militants were injured in the strike last Saturday, and Jihadi John was taken to a hospital in al-Qaim, Iraq, before being transported to the Islamic State group\u2019s headquarters in Raqqa, Syria. Baghdadi was also reported wounded in the attack.\n\nThe British Foreign Office told the Daily Mail it is investigating the accuracy of the reports, but is hampered by a lack of presence in Syria where ISIS controls a large swath of territory.\n\n\u201cThe incident occurred last weekend, and so we have received the reports in the last few days,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports.\u201d\n\nJihadi John was the name given by the media to the masked figure who had a British accent and appeared in the beheading videos of Foley, Sotloff and the British hostages David Haines and Alan Henning.

The report in the Independent newspaper, published in London, quoted officials of the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East.\n\nAccording to the officials, Islamic State terrorists could basically enter the city at will, as there is little substantial defense to prevent them from doing so. \"The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad,\" the spokesperson said. \u201cThey said it could never happen and now it almost has. [US President Barack] Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do,\" the report quoted the spokesperson as saying.\n\nObama indeed made that admission Sunday night, in an interview broadcast on CBS news program 60 Minutes. \u201cOver the past couple of years, during the chaos of the Syrian civil war, where essentially you have huge swathes of the country that are completely ungoverned,\" the president said, Islamic State was \"able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos.\n\n\"This became ground zero for jihadists around the world,\" Obama said of Syria, where Islamic State now controls territory in the east around on the city of Raqqa. \u201cWhere you've got states that are failing or in the midst of civil war, these kinds of organizations thrive,\" he said.\n\nIn a separate development over the weekend, the head of the Syrian Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra Front said that it would work with Islamic State to defeat the \u201cWestern infidels,\u201d reports said. \"Muslims will not watch while their sons are bombed.

Colleen Clarke-Murphy's daughter brought the stray cat home, and when the family took it to the vet, they were told it has both male and female genitalia, CBC reports.\n\nMittens' dual gender has caused the cat to have bowel and urinary troubles. The solution: Spay and neuter the cat, then assign a gender (the vet recommends male) and give it reconstructive surgery.\n\nThe cost: $1,500, which a friend is helping the family raise. Clarke-Murphy says it's worth it, because Mittens has been \"part of my family\" since October.\n\nAs Bustle and Cosmopolitan point out, while hermaphroditic cats are rare, gender-related operations in cats aren't as uncommon as you might imagine.

Pentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such an attack or on the militant leader being injured.\n\nIraq's Defence and Interior ministries both issued statements saying al-Baghdadi had been wounded, without elaborating, and the news was broadcast on state-run television Sunday night.\n\nThe reports came at a time when U.S. President Barack Obama said the U.S.-led coalition was in a position to start going on the offensive against the ISIS militants.\n\nAl-Baghdadi, believed to be in his early 40s, has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al-Qaida into an independent transnational military force.\n\nHe has positioned himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community. His forces have seized large parts of Syria and Iraq, killed thousands of people, beheaded Westerners and drawn the U.S. troops and warplanes back into the region, where Washington is leading a campaign of airstrikes by a multinational coalition.\n\nAn Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press that al-Baghdadi was wounded by an Iraqi airstrike that came during a meeting Saturday with militants in the town of Qaim. The official cited informants within the militant group. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.\n\nU.S. also targeted ISIS leaders in weekend strikes\n\nThe operation was carried out by Iraqi security forces, both officials said, although they did not know how seriously al-Baghdadi was hurt. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss confidential material.\n\nA statement posted Sunday on the official Facebook page of Defence Minister Khalid Obeidi also said al-Baghdadi was wounded, but added that he was targeted in the northern city of Mosul, currently the group's biggest stronghold in Iraq. A senior U.S. defence official said Saturday that the coalition conducted a series of airstrikes targeting a gathering of ISIS leaders near Mosul, but he could not confirm whether al-Baghdadi was part of the gathering.\n\nReports circulated Saturday that al-Baghdadi may have been wounded in an airstrike, but there was no confirmation at that time from either U.S. or Iraqi officials.\n\nThe U.S. Central Command said Friday it conducted two airstrikes near Qaim that destroyed a militant armoured vehicle and two checkpoints of the militant group, which is also known by the acronyms ISIL and ISIS. On Nov. 1, the U.S. military conducted four strikes in the town.\n\nWhen asked about the Iraqi reports, Air Force Col. Patrick Ryder, spokesman for U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, said Sunday: \"We have no information to corroborate reports that ISIL leader al-Baghdadi has been injured.\"\n\nRami Abdurrahman, director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said some ISIS militants wounded in the airstrike near Qaim were taken across the frontier to the Syrian border town of Boukamal.\n\n\"They brought ISIS injured to Aisha Hospital in Boukamal. We don't know if somebody died there or not. We know for sure that they brought some of the ISIS people injured in Roummaneh to the hospital,\" Abdurrahman said.\n\nThere was no indication that al-Baghdadi was among those brought to Boukamal.\n\n'They brought ISIS injured to Aisha Hospital in Boukamal. We don't know if somebody died there or not. We know for sure that they brought some of the ISIS people injured in Roummaneh to the hospital.'\n- Rami Abdurrahman, director of Syrian Observatory for Human Rights\nThe reclusive al-Baghdadi is known to have made only one public appearance, purportedly delivering a sermon at a mosque in Mosul, as seen in a video posted online in June. That came five days after his group declared the establishment of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territories it holds in Iraq and Syria. The group proclaimed al-Baghdadi its leader and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him.\n\nSince then, part of the Islamic State group's core strategy has been to establish administration over lands that it controls to project an image of itself as more than just a fighting force. In parts of Syria under its control, the group administers courts, repairs roads and even polices traffic.

Officials have not ruled out that he may have been injured.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still looking at it very closely,\u201d said an Iraqi intelligence official. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing yet, and as time ticks on it may be less likely.\u201d\n\nJihadist forums have remained mute since the strike took place. The death of Baghdadi would be difficult to keep quiet even among the tight discipline of Isis, which has proven difficult for Iraqi, or international agencies, to penetrate ever since it changed the modern face of the Middle East in June when it made rapid territorial gains in Iraq and seized Mosul, the country\u2019s second largest city.\n\nIraqis officials claimed to have killed two senior Isis members on Saturday in a raid they carried out on the town of al-Qaim near the Syrian border. The raid took place on a house where senior leaders were meeting and is thought to have killed the overall leader of Anbar province, Adnan Latif al-Suweidi, and Isis\u2019s leader in the Euphrates valley, Bashar al-Muhandi. Both held senior leadership positions in the organisation.\n\nTargeted raids, carried out by the US and its Arab allies in the region, have proven effective in slowing the momentum of the group, according to Iraqi officials and one senior Isis member.However, they have failed to curtail its strategic aims.\n\nThe air strike near Mosul came hours after Barack Obama said he would double the number of US troops deployed to Iraq to reinforce the offensive against Isis. On Sunday, the US president said the troop surge will place the US on the front foot as it confronts the group.\n\nIn his first public comments since his surge announcement, Obama denied it represented a failure of early reliance on air strikes and said the deployment announced on Friday night \u201csignals a new phase\u201d in his campaign against Islamic State \u2013 known as Isis or Isil.\n\n\u201cRather than just try to halt to Isil\u2019s momentum, we are now in a position to start going on some offensive,\u201d he told Face The Nation on CBS.\n\n\u201cThe airstrikes have been very effective in degrading Isil\u2019s abilities and slowing the advances they were making, now we need some ground troops, Iraqi ground troops, to start pushing them back.\u201d\n\nThe White House insists the new US troops will be focused on training Iraqis to fight Isis and then co-ordinating air strikes, rather that being involved in what it calls an active combat role.\n\n\u201cWhat hasn\u2019t changed is our troops are not engaged in combat, essentially what we are doing is we are taking four training centres with coalition members that allow us to bring in Iraqi troops, some of the Sunni tribes that are still resisting Isil, giving them proper training, proper equipment, helping them with strategy, helping them with logistics,\u201d said Obama.\n\nIraqi forces have performed abysmally since Isis stormed into Mosul on 10 June. In the chaotic two days that followed, up to six divisions fled, surrendering their US-supplied advanced weapons. Since then, Shia militias have increasingly taken prominence in most frontlines across the country.\n\n\u201cWe will provide them with close air support once they are prepared to start going on the offensive against Isil, but what we won\u2019t be doing is having our own troops do the fighting,\u201d he added.\n\nBut the president also refused to rule out further increases in military engagement in Iraq and Syria, which already include daily bombing raids on Isis in both countries.\n\n\u201cAs the commander in chief, I am never going to say never,\u201d he said when asked whether more troops would be sent. \u201cBut what the commanders presented the plan to me say is that we may actually see fewer troops over time because now we are seeing coalition members starting to partner with us on the training and assist effort.\u201d\n\nObama insists this time it will be different because attacks on Isis will only be led by Iraqis.\n\n\u201cWhat we learned from previous engagement in Iraq is that our military is always the best, we can always knock out any threat, but then when we leave that threat comes back,\u201d he said.","The female militia fighter became famous after a picture of her making the peace sign went viral on Twitter but Kurdish sources have rejected claims she has been killed\n\nIslamic State terrorists claim to have beheaded the poster girl of the Kurdish militia\u2019s battle for freedom in Syria.\n\nThe female fighter, known only by the name Rehana, became famous after a picture of her making the peace sign went viral on Twitter.\n\nShe is said to have killed more than 100 jihadists in the battle for the strategically important town of Kobane, on the Turkey-Syria border.\n\nNow IS has claimed that a photo of a grinning rebel holding a woman\u2019s severed head is evidence that she is dead.\n\nBut Kurdish journalist Pawan Durani said it was untrue.\n\nHe wrote today: \u201cRehana is very much alive.

Alcorn left a suicide note on her Tumblr account which has since gone viral. Posting the suicide note, Leelah Alcorn said her Christian parents refused to acknowledge her gender beliefs and forbid her from transitioning into a female.\n\nThe Leelah Alcorn suicide note begins by stating, \u201cIf you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.\u201d\n\nThe note posted by the transgender teenager was scheduled to post just several hours after Alcorn committed suicide by walking onto Ohio I-71 in the Kings Mill area and stepping in front of a tractor-trailer.\n\nOhio transgender teen Joshua Alcorn committed suicide and blame Christian parents.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was,\u201d the Leelah Acorn suicide note said. \u201cI immediately told my mom and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that is was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn\u2019t make mistakes, that I am wrong.\u201d\n\nThe transgender teen went on to say that her parents would not allow her to transition and began taking her to Christian therapists who allegedly told her that she was \u201cselfish and wrong.\u201d Alcorn added in the suicide note, \u201cI formed a sort of a f**k you attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans, it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them.\u201d\n\nThe transgender teen\u2019s viral suicide note goes on to state, \u201cThey wanted me to be their prefect little straight Christian boy, and that\u2019s obviously not what I wanted. On my 16th birthday, when I didn\u2019t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman, who hates herself.\u201d\n\nAnother excerpt from the suicide letter reads, \u201cSo they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t kill myself. I was completely alone for five months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent\u2019s disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness. At the end of the school year, my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media. I was excited, I finally had my friends back. They were extremely excited to see me and talk to me, but only at first. Eventually, they realized they didn\u2019t actually give a sh*t about me, and I felt even lonelier than I did before. The only friends I thought I had only liked me because they saw me five times a week.\u201d\n\nThe remainder of Alcorn\u2019s suicide letter states, \u201cAfter a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like sh*t because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I\u2019ve had enough. I\u2019m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I\u2019m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I\u2019m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I\u2019m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I\u2019m never going to find a man who loves me. I\u2019m never going to be happy. There\u2019s no way out. I\u2019m sad enough already, I don\u2019t need my life to get any worse. People say \u2018it gets better\u2019 but that isn\u2019t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the gist of it, that\u2019s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry, if that\u2019s not a good enough reason for you, it\u2019s good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100 percent of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don\u2019t give a sh*t which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren\u2019t treated the way I was, they\u2019re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier, the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year.

Drop some morsel of news in the dead of August, and it\u2019s like tossing the last bite of a Shake Shack burger to a flock of pigeons in Central Park.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tony Gallagher and Howard Bloom chucked their meat and the flock went crazy. Gallagher said that NHL expansion to Las Vegas was a \u201cdone deal,\u201d and then Bloom upped the ante by claiming that the NHL will add Vegas, Seattle, a second Toronto franchise and Quebec City by 2017, the 100th anniversary of the League.\n\n(No word on whether the League will begin an aggressive cloning program to fill out those rosters with NHL-level talent. Protect your comb, Jonathan Toews, they\u2019re coming for DNA samples!)\n\nBill Daly of the NHL said the four-team expansion is \"not in\" the NHL's plans. Because what else is he supposed to say...\n\nGallagher of The Province wrote with finality that the NHL was coming to Las Vegas through expansion:\n\nSources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.\n\nAnd given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago, this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed.\n\nYou know, we started getting an inkling that Bettman had changed his tune on Las Vegas when he moved one of the league\u2019s signature promotional events there in 2009, but yes, this is a considerable about-face indeed!\n\nSo, in summary, expansion to Las Vegas is a \u201cdone deal\u201d except for the fact that there isn\u2019t an ownership group that\u2019s been approved by the Board of Governors; nor is there an expansion fee established for the market that would, in theory, determine who\u2019s willing to buy-in (oooh, Vegas parlance!).\n\nLook, we\u2019re all in total squee-mode for a team in Vegas. Or really any declaration that expansion is going to happen. But the proliferation of this \u201cdone deal\u201d report \u2013 by Tony Gallagher, no less \u2013 is the most Hockey August moment in the history of Hockey August.\n\nFor the love of Balsillie, he actually writes \u201cthe only thing to be determined\u201d is the group actually owning the team.

And with the NHL pulling in record revenue, attendance and ratings, the iron hasn\u2019t been hotter to strike for expansion.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve noted previously about Vegas: It\u2019s unlike any other market in professional sports. There\u2019s unrivaled competition for entertainment dollars. Many of the people who would attend the games as local fans are working while the games are being played. The largest target audience for the team would be the casinos who fill the considerable luxury box space in the new arena and tourists who pop in to see a game while in Sin City \u2013 or, perhaps, get comp\u2019d for one.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t surprise us in the least to see the NHL dive into the market, despite those mysteries, just to be first ones in and because Bettman obviously believes an association with Vegas brings some level of prestige to the League.\n\nBut what about the other three teams?\n\nBloom, of Sports Business News, reported later on Tuesday that the NHL was going full-on expansiongasm by adding every city that it\u2019s considering adding for the last several years. Four new franchises, none through relocation:\n\n\u201cNHL expansion \u2013 four teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following the Seattle angle, you know the situation: Chris Hansen \u2013 the billionaire, not the predator catcher \u2013 has an arena construction deal with the city that hangs on attracting an NBA team; the only hope for an NHL team there first is if Hansen has a change of heart, and Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman is working with him to that end.\n\nThen comes the real fight: Convincing a city council that has otherwise been apathetic to hockey to turn on the funding faucet for an NHL team\u2019s arena.\n\nThen there\u2019s Quebec City, which will have an NHL-ready arena next year and has no shortage of financial powerhouses ready to step up for an expansion franchise. It\u2019s also been the most public and hubristic bid for a team, otherwise known as the opposite of how Gary Bettman likes to operate.\n\nThen there\u2019s a second team in Toronto, which remains the best idea out of all of these options. Then again, what media conglomerates are left to own a team there? The Score app?\n\nAnd what level of bribery to the Leafs would it take to even crack that market?\n\nBloom believes this will happen because the NHL won\u2019t be able to keep itself from collecting that expansion franchise windfall, and that\u2019s as solid a theory as any. It makes sense that the League would expand quickly before losing that expansion money to another relocation (/casts an eye at Florida and Arizona).\n\nAll of this makes sense from a timing perspective and, of course, because we understand the League\u2019s avarice. There are still significant obstacles in a couple of these markets, but it\u2019s not outrageous to think it could happen.\n\nWhich leaves us with the biggest decisions of all: The nicknames! Seattle Sasquatch, Las Vegas Craps, Quebec Nordiques (\u2018natch) and Toronto Rakes (the sworn enemy of Leafs)!","A video has been released today showing the gruesome murder of the 31-year-old journalist - weeks after the brutal beheading of James Foley by a British terrorist\n\nRefresh automatically On | Off       6:56 pm    The video showing the apparent beheading is called \"A second message to America\" .It is believed to show the journalist speak to the camera shortly before he is murdered.As reported by CNN, Sotloff says he is \"paying the price\" for U.S. intervention.The militant in the video tells US President Barack Obama: \"Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.\"     6:46 pm    This harrowing picture shows Steven Sotloff standing next to an ISIS militant.The image was taken from the same video which showed the beheading of James Foley.

Gardner. He was 88.\n\nPolice responded to a call around 9 a.m. PDT and confirmed Hefner's identity from other residents of the Playboy Mansion, Gardner said. Police are not releasing a more specific cause of death at this time. \"We'll have to wait for an autopsy report for an official cause of death,\" said Gardner. \"From what I have heard Mr. Hefner was in good health for an 88 year old man. With no signs of foul-play we are left to believe his death was of natural causes.\"\n\nHefner's long publication career first began as a copywriter for Esquire, which was cut short in 1952 after being denied a $5 raise. Less than a year later, after mortgaging his furniture and generating loans from everywhere from banks to even his mother, Hefner launched Playboy. The racy magazine was nearly a hit from its first issue published in December 1953, which featured Marilyn Monroe from her 1949 nude calendar shoot and sold over 50,000 copies.\n\nHowever, the Playboy venture wasn't initially all fun and games. On June 4, 1963, Hefner found himself in trouble with the law after being arrested for selling obscene literature after an issue of Playboy featuring nude shots of Jayne Mansfield was released. A jury was unable to reach a verdict.\n\nHe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for television and has made several movie appearances as himself. In 2009, he received a \"worst supporting actor\" nomination for a Razzie award for his performance in Miss March.\n\nHefner's death comes as a shock to millions. Despite his older age, the Playboy tycoon was in excellent physical shape.\n\nHefner was quoted as saying, \"Life is too short to be living someone else's dream.\" As a pioneer in the industry, this is a quote he took to heart.\n\nThis story is still developing.

The smaller form factor would bring back the ease of one-hand usage that was lost when Apple introduced its larger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets. The supply chain sources suggest the new phone may debut in the second half 2015 with female users as the targeted audience for the smaller phone.\n\nEven without a new 4-inch model, Apple's history of product lineups suggests the 4-inch iPhone 5s would remain in the lineup in 2015 as the low-end offering once the current models slide down and the iPhone 5c is presumably discontinued. But if Apple wants to maintain a 4-inch option beyond the 2015 lineup, it would make sense to invest in an updated version of that size as the iPhone 5s ages.\n\nStill, the sourcing on today's rumor is not entirely clear and a track record is unknown, so it is difficult to assess the potential validity of the claim. As a result, we would not put too much stock in it for the time being until or unless additional information surfaces in the coming months.\n\nEven without a new 4-inch model this year, iPhone sales have been strong for the new 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, with Apple setting a new sales record in the first weekend of availability.

The life I would've lived isn't worth living in\u2026 because I'm transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy's body, and I've felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally \"boyish\" things to try to fit in.\n\nWhen I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness.

That's exactly what it did to me.\n\nMy mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.\n\nWhen I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.\nAlcorn apparently believed she'd never be able to transition successfully. She concludes:\n\nAfter a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I've had enough. I'm never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I'm never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I'm never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I'm never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I'm never going to find a man who loves me. I'm never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There's no winning. There's no way out. I'm sad enough already, I don't need my life to get any worse. People say \"it gets better\" but that isn't true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.\n\nThat's the gist of it, that's why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that's not a good enough reason for you, it's good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don't give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say \"that's fucked up\" and fix it. Fix society. Please.\nOn Facebook, Alcorn's mother has written, \"My sweet 16 year old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn went home to heaven this morning.

They'll \"likely be used to carry both to-be-sold inventory as well as to store demo units from the show floor overnight,\" the tech blog reports.\n\nApple is also working on special weight scales for measuring the Apple Watch. This is to stop customers buying the device, secretly removing or replacing the gold, and then returning it to the store after selling the precious metal on.\n\nSo how much is the 18K gold Apple watch retailing for? It's not yet confirmed, but rumours peg the price point at somewhere between $1,200 and $5,000. The regular models are a bargain in comparison, starting at just $349.\n\nAccording to Apple CEO Tim Cook, we should expect to see an Apple Watch launch at some point in April \u2014 though tester models are already being spotted in the wild.\n\nHere's a promotional photo of the gold model:\n\nAnd here's how it looks on the wrist:","Apple Watch will take approximately two hours to fully charge and deliver all-day battery life with normal on-and-off usage, according to TechCrunch. Those estimates corroborate a previous report that also claimed the Apple Watch will deliver all-day battery life and support up to five hours of heavy usage per charge.\n\nThe report also claims that the Apple Watch will only deliver notifications while worn on the wrist. The smartwatch will not ping you for notifications without being in contact with skin so that the device is not disruptive at unnecessary times. Apple Watch will also stop delivering notifications when the battery reaches 10% or lower in an effort to conserve the remaining power.\"Here\u2019s a tidbit you might not know \u2014 in order to receive notifications from apps, the Watch must be on your wrist and locked. They require contact with your skin. There will be no in-app dropdown notifications or constant pinging while it\u2019s off your wrist. Push notifications also cease when the battery reaches 10 percent. Those decisions speak to the care with which Apple is handling notifications.\"Apple continues to tweak Digital Crown on the Apple Watch, giving the button a \"weightier, higher-end feel.\" Pressing and holding down the Digital Crown activates Siri, which the report claims works well and can be used for labeling, directions and commands using a paired iPhone. The goal of the Apple Watch, the report describes, is to return some of your attention away from your smartphone by allowing you to communicate from your wrist on the go.\n\nWhile both reports this afternoon have provided a closer look at the Apple Watch, there are still several question marks surrounding the wrist-worn device. That will change in less than three days, when Apple provides more details about the Apple Watch at its highly-anticipated \"Spring Forward\" media event in San Francisco. The keynote begins on Monday at 10 AM Pacific and MacRumors will be providing live coverage of the event.\n\nRelated roundup: Apple Watch , Tag: techcrunch.com","The families of murdered American journalists Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff are speaking out against the US government for making their efforts to free their loved ones a \"helpless\" endeavor.\n\nThe parents of Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who was kidnapped by militants in Syria, told Yahoo News on Friday that a member of the president's National Security Council threatened them with criminal prosecution if they attempted to pay a ransom to get their son freed.\n\n\"The family felt completely and utterly helpless when they heard this,\" Barak Barfi, a friend of Sotloff who is serving as a spokesman for his family, told Yahoo News. \"The Sotloffs felt there was nothing they could do to get Steve out.\"\n\nSotloff's mother, Shirley, recorded an emotional video directly addressing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in late August. Despite her plea for mercy, the group murdered her son one week later.\n\nThe claim that the government would bring charges against the Sotloff family echoes similar points made in a CNN interview with Jim Foley's mother Diane, in which she said she was \"embarrassed and appalled\" by the US government's handling of her son's case.\n\nIn the interview, Diane Foley listed things the US government advised the family not to do, including not going to the media and not to raise a ransom since it would be illegal \u2014 \"we might be prosecuted,\" Foley said she was told. She also says the government told her it would not exchange prisoners or conduct a military action to go after him.\n\n\"We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,\" she said. \"And he wasn't, was he?\"\n\nJim Foley, a freelance journalist who was working for GlobalPost in Syria, was brutally murdered in mid-August soon after the US began airstrikes against ISIS militants in Iraq.\n\n\"It just made me realize that these people talking to us had no idea what it was like to be the family of someone abducted ... \" Diane Foley told ABC News. \"I\u2019m sure [the US official] didn\u2019t mean it the way he said it, but we were between a rock and a hard place. We were told we could do nothing \u2026 meanwhile our son was being beaten and tortured every day.\u201d\n\nThe US military attempted a rescue operation in July to find Foley, Sotloff, and other hostages believed to be held near ISIS' de facto capital of Raqqa, Syria, although the special operations troops were unable to locate any of them. The Wall Street Journal reported the hostages were likely moved as little as 72 hours prior to the raid.","IBM may be set to announce big layoffs this week.\n\nIBM (IBM) shares were higher in early trading on unconfirmed reports that it\u2019s getting set to slash 26% of its workforce, or nearly 112,000 jobs as part of reorganization plan dubbed \"Project Chrome.\"  The massive jobs cuts would be the biggest in IBM's history and comes after the company reported its 11th straight quarter of declining revenue.

She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.\n\n\"I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,\" Tridevil said on a recent radio broadcast. \"Because I don\u2019t want to date anymore.\"\n\nGiven the fact that most men love boobs, I'm not entirely sure getting another one is the fastest route to unattractiveness, but her attempted commitment to misandry is commendable.

And the picture of beheaded female fighter is not Rehana's picture,' he told MailOnline, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nHe went on to say that he saw Rehana leave Kobane during intense fighting there last week, shortly before he was forced to do the same thing.\n\nAlthough he lost temporarily lost contact with Rehana as they made their separate journeys over the nearby Turkish border, the journalist said he has been informed by friends that she is living as a refugee in Turkey, most likely in the southern \u015eanliurfa Province.\n\n'She is in Turkey. I will try to gain her number because I lost the connection with her. She evacuated Kobane and I stayed in Kobane. At the beginning of the last clashes Rehana left Kobane,' he said.\n\nBrave: Thousands of Syrian Kurdish women are battling the Islamic State in Syria, many of them in Kobane\n\nMailOnline also spoke to another friend of Rehana's who confirmed the dead woman in the sickening ISIS photograph was not Rehana, who she described as 'the daughter of a martyr'.\n\n'The facial features [of the head in the ISIS photo] are not hers,' she said, refusing to give her name.\n\nHowever the friend claimed she was not with Rehana, had not seen her since the time the photograph emerged, and no longer had any way of contacting her.\n\n'I can give news on her, but I don't want to talk until I get someone's advice... A person in Kobane has refuted this news [that she is dead], and I'm going to speak to him again tomorrow,' the friend said.\n\n'Everyone's asking about her, using her. And I don't want to talk about her,' she went on to say.\n\nThe friends' claims that Rehana is still alive was reinforced by others who says they know Rehana and have spoken to her in recent days.\n\nAmong those claiming to have communicated with Rehana is the Syrian/Kurdish journalist Rashad Abdel Qader.\n\nQader said rumours that she had singlehandedly killed 100 ISIS fighters inside Kobane were untrue, but claimed she was still 'fighting fiercely'.\n\nA female Kurdish fighter takes up a position during combat skills training before being deployed to fight ISIS\n\nThe suggestion Rehana may still be alive was first raised by the Swedish freelance journalist Carl Drott, who said he had met her during a ceremony in which the Kurdish YPJ, or Women's Defense Unit, was first set up in Kobane.\n\nHe said the dead woman in the ISIS photograph may initially look like Rehana, but on closer inspection her facial features and hair style and colour betrayed subtle differences.\n\nHe also said that as Rehana had left a law degree in Aleppo to fight join the fight in her hometown Kobane, she hadn't received the level of training required to become a full member of the YPJ and so worked as a reservist, providing support to those on the frontline.\n\nSuch claims might it highly unlikely she would have been able to singlehandedly kill 100 ISIS fighters, as per the rumours that spread when the photograph of her making the peace sign first emerged.\n\nSyrian Kurds gather in the Turkish town of Suruc for the funeral of Kurdish fighters killed by ISIS in Kobane\n\nThe news that Rehana is almost certainly still alive came as Kurdish resistance fighters continue to push the Islamic State back in Kobane.\n\nAmong those fighters are thousands of women, an unusual phenomenon in the Muslim world in which warfare is often associated with manhood. In April, Kurdish fighters created all-female combat units that have grown to include more than 10,000 women.\n\nThese female fighters have played a major role in battles against IS, said Nasser Haj Mansour, a defense official in Syria's Kurdish region.\n\nThe Kurdish women now find themselves battling militants preaching an extreme form of Islam dictating that women only leave the house if absolutely necessary.\n\nOne Kurdish female fighter, who uses the nom de guerre of Afshin Kobani, used to be a teacher.\n\nNow, the Kurdish Syrian woman has traded the classroom for the front lines in the battle for the town.\n\nThe 28-year-old Kurdish fighter said she decided to join the fight in her hometown when she saw Isis advances in Syria.\n\n'I lost many friends to this, and I decided there was a need to join up,' said Kobani, who declined to reveal her birth name. 'This is our land - our own - and if we don't do it, who else will?'\n\nThe funeral for three Kurdish fighters who died fighting ISIS in Kobane was held in Suruc, Turkey last week\n\nYoung Kurdish in Suruc, Turkey men paint the tombstone of a YPG fighter killed over the border in Kobane\n\nAfter more than a year of fighting, Kobani has risen through the ranks to become a commander of a mixed-gender unit. 'We are just the same as men; there's no difference,' she said. 'We can do any type of job, including armed mobilization.'\n\nThere is nothing new about Kurdish women fighters. They have fought alongside men for years in a guerrilla war against Turkey, seeking an independent Kurdistan which would encompass parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran.\n\nThe campaign for Kurdish independence has been pursued mainly by leftist militant groups that championed gender equality, such as the Kurdistan Workers Party in Turkey.\n\nSuicide bombings have long been part of the Kurdish women fighters' battleground repertory.\n\nEarly this month, Deilar Kanj Khamis, better known by her military name Arin Mirkan, blew herself up outside Kobani, killing 10 IS fighters, according to Kurdish forces.\n\nHaj Mansour, the Kurdish defense official, recounted that Kurdish fighters were forced to withdraw from a strategic hill south of the besieged town. Khamis stayed behind, attacking IS fighters with gunfire and grenades as they moved in.\n\nEarlier this month the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors events in Syria, reported ISIS militants beheaded nine Kurdish fighters, including three women\n\nSurrounded, she detonated explosives strapped to her body. The Kurds then recaptured the position - but lost it again on Wednesday.\n\nEarlier this month the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors events in Syria, reported Isis militants beheaded nine Kurdish fighters, including three women, captured in clashes near Turkish border.\n\nThe news that Rehana is almost certainly still alive comes as militants from the Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front attacked the government-held Syrian city of Idlib, killing dozens of soldiers loyal to the regime and temporarily taking control of a number of buildings.\n\nThe militants were later pushed back into the outskirts of the city, which has been held by the government after being briefly seized by rebel forces in 2012.\n\nDo you know Rehana?

That would be a big deal and a major escalation of problems over in that part of the world, far beyond what it would do to capital markets.\"\n\nYesterday there were attacks on Shi'ites (as Reuters reported)\n\nSaudi security forces on Tuesday shot dead a member of an armed group that killed five people in an overnight attack on Shi'ite Muslims marking an important religious anniversary, al-Arabiya television reported.\n\nThe late Monday assault on a Shi'ite gathering in al-Ahsa district is likely to test already strained relations between Sunnis and Shi'ites across the Middle East because it coincided with the annual Ashoura commemoration of Shi'ite Islam.\n\nThe Dubai-based al-Arabiya said security forces who had been hunting suspects in the al-Ahsa attack clashed with and killed \"a wanted man\" at a rest area in the al-Qassim province, north-west of the capital Riyadh.\n... and today, what is allegedly an Aramco pipeline, just exploded near the town of Sudair, south of Riyadh.\n\n\n\n*  *  *\n\nThe Region:\n\n\n\n*  *  *\n\nHas sent stocks and the currency reeling.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd sparked a $2 surge in WTI crude\n\n\n\n*  *  *\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nIt would appear the Saudis might need US 'protection' after all.. how convenient as they continue their attacks on the US Shale industry.\n\nAs OilPro adds, two other discussions are going around trading desks:\n\nThis is a way to get oil prices to go back up without the Saudis appearing to give in and defend price by voluntarily cutting supply. A pipeline explosion will automatically decrease production.\nThe US Elections are over, time for prices at the pump to go back up now. This plays on the long-tenured theory that gasoline prices tend to be lowest right before elections as the incumbent party leverages their power to please the masses.","Hewlett-Packard may be ready for a breakup.\n\nHP, the world's second largest PC vendor behind Lenovo, plans to separate its PC and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and other enterprise operations, reported The Wall Street Journal on Sunday, citing \"people familiar with the matter.\" The company could announced the move as early as Monday, according to the Journal's sources.\n\nHP declined to comment.\n\nCEO Meg Whitman will be chairman of the new PC and printer business and chief executive of the separate \"enterprise company,\" one source told the Journal, while board member Patricia Russo will chairman of the enterprise company.

At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.\n\n\"By this time we did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy's mother] know.

The move would entitle Las Vegas to a professional sports franchise in one of the four major sports league's for the first time in the city's history. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has previously voiced disapproval of such a move out of concern over the city's potentially damaging connection to the sports betting industry.\nOn Wednesday morning, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly publicly denied that anything was imminent in Las Vegas.\n\nSeattle has been at the center of expansion rumors for more than a year and Quebec City has a new arena that is slated to open in 2015.

Turns out, there's a custom involving Argentina's President taking god children, and a myth about werewolves, and other than involving seventh sons, they are unrelated, according to a report in the Guardian Monday.\n\nAccording to Argentinian custom, the country's president takes the seventh child of Argentine families as a godchild. The honor only applied to Catholic children before 2009. According to reports, Kirchner took Yair Tawil as a godson after his parents were initially denied in their request in 1993. He appealed and last week became the first Jewish god son of the country's president.\n\nEarlier reports, including one in UPI, explained that according to Argentinian legend, the seventh son in a daughter-less family will turn into a werewolf (\"el lobison\") on his 13th birthday.\n\n\"The legend became so feared that families would abandon or kill their sons,\" the UPI story stated. \"To counteract this stigma, the president of Argentina began in 1907 to adopt one of the boys as their godson.\"\n\nBut Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda told the Guardian that the two traditions aren't actually linked.\n\n\"The local myth of the lobiz\u00f3n is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,\" he explained.\n\nAccording to Balmaceda, the later custom was actually started in the early 1900s by German and Russian emigres who brought the tradition to Argentina from Europe. The custom became official law in 1974, unrelated to werewolves.\n\nHere's one of de Kirchner's tweets from last week's ceremony:","Apple could be planning to introduce the much-rumored 12-inch Retina MacBook Air during its March 9 Apple Watch event, according to one site that claims to have sources within Apple. The Michael Report believes Apple will use the event to debut the ultrathin MacBook, which is rumored to have a Retina display and a redesigned chassis.Many are expecting Apple talk more about the Apple Watch. However, sources familiar with the matter within Apple have exclusively told The Michael Report that Apple plans to unveil the long-awaited Retina MacBook Air at the same event. The Michael Report has independently verified this information to be highly credible.While there have been no concrete rumors from major sites linking the Retina MacBook Air to Apple's March 9 event, previous rumors have indicated that Apple is planning for a spring release. Apple supplier Quanta is said to have begun mass production of the notebook in January, and KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted a March launch for the MacBook.\n\nRendering of the 12-inch Retina MacBook Air created by Martin Hajek\nWhen taking these rumors into account, along with the fact that the MacBook Air is due for an update, the introduction of the Retina MacBook Air at Apple's March 9 event does seem like a possibility. It's also possible Apple will introduce new models of the existing 11 and 13-inch MacBook Air at the event -- the last update was in April and there was a rumor suggesting an update in February was imminent. Core M Broadwell chips believed to be appropriate for the 12-inch Retina MacBook have been available since November, and chips appropriate for the standard MacBook Air began shipping in January.\n\nAlong with a Retina display, the 12-inch MacBook Air is rumored to come without a fan assembly for silent operation, made possible by the aforementioned Core M chips, and it may also include a revamped trackpad that does not incorporate a mechanical button. It is said to feature smaller bezels in a Retina MacBook Pro-style black, a keyboard that stretches right to the edges of the machine, and speakers that are located above the keyboard.\n\nThe Michael Report has a mixed track record when it comes to rumors. The site accurately predicted some design elements of the iPad Air 2, but its predictions may have been based on dummy models that were circulating around the Internet at the time. The site also shared details on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus ahead of their launch, inaccurately calling the iPhone 6 Plus the \"iPhone 6L\" and suggesting the iPhones would come with quad-core processors and sapphire displays.\n\nMore details about what Apple plans to unveil at its Monday, March 9 event may come out through the week. Thus far, many sites have agreed that the focal point of the event will be the Apple Watch, with Apple unveiling new details about the device like its price and its official launch date.\n\nRelated roundup: Retina MacBook Air , Tag: themichaelreport.com","POLICE are investigating claims a doctor took a selfie with Joan Rivers while she was unconscious on the operating table, before performing a biopsy she hadn\u2019t consented to.\n\nThe shocking claim was made by a staff member at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, where Rivers underwent a routine throat procedure on August 28.\n\nAfter complications, the 81-year-old comedian was rushed to hospital where she died a week later.\n\nSHOCK LOSS: Joan Rivers dead at 81\n\nInvestigators are looking in to claims that a second unnamed doctor entered the operating room after that initial procedure to conduct a biopsy on her vocal chords.\n\nThey are also probing claims by the staff member that the clinician who performed the biopsy first snapped a photo of himself with the sedated star.\n\nFOND FAREWELL: Star-studded send-off at Joan Rivers\u2019 funeral\n\nCNN cited a source close to the investigation as saying that the vocal chord biopsy was not something Rivers had consented to.\n\nThat same source also said investigators believe Rivers could have suffered a heart attack after her throat began to swell during the biopsy, depriving her of oxygen.\n\nYorkville Endoscopy issued a statement denying the biopsy had taken place, but declined to comment on the selfie accusation.","Egyptian President al-Sisi reportedly offered to extend the Gaza Strip.","While Apple's iPhone 6 has only been out in the market for four months, there are already rumors regarding the upcoming iPhone 6S.\n\nThe iPhone 6S will not be released until over half a year from now, but rumors out of Taiwan are suggesting that Apple is considering a dual-lens system for the smartphone's camera, according to website UDN, citing sources from Apple's supply chain in Asia.\n\nIn addition, \"Force Touch,\" the pressure-sensitive touch system technology which will be launched with the release of the Apple Watch, could also be included in the iPhone 6S.\n\nThe transition into a dual-lens system for the iPhone 6S's camera will allow Apple to include an optical zoom feature on their flagship smartphone for the first time. The camera module of the iPhone 6S, which will likely undergo a redesign, will also lead to improvements in the low-light photo capture performance for the smartphone by allowing additional light to enter the camera's sensor.\n\nApple has been making sizeable investments in the company's imaging technology, counting the camera of the iPhone as one of its most marketable assets. As such, the camera of the iPhone is a possible area of interest for upgrades to be made in the future.\n\nThe camera sensor in the iPhone 6 Plus, which was supplied to Apple by Sony, includes features such as optical image stabilization and phase-detection autofocus. As such, the camera of the iPhone 6 Plus has received praise from experts as the \"best smartphone camera ever made,\" rivaling even the quality of many current models of point-and-shoot cameras.\n\nIn addition to the rumors regarding the camera of the iPhone 6S, TPK, a touch module supplier based in Taiwan, is said to be a possible supplier of three-dimensional touch sensors for the smartphone. These sensors will bring Force Touch technology to the iPhone 6S, a feature that will be introduced in the upcoming wearable device Apple Watch.\n\nFor the Apple Watch, Force Touch will allow the device to detect the amount of pressure applied by the user in touch commands, which will then translate to different input commands. For example, users pressing heavily on the device's screen can bring up a list of options, and a light press on the screen can then select one of those options. Such a feature could prove to be useful in the iPhone 6S.\n\nUDN also thinks that the feature will be included in the smartphone to lead to higher accuracy in the reading of the pulse and blood pressure of the user as an additional input sensor for Apple's HealthKit system.","Hewlett-Packard is officially splitting in two. Following rumors over the weekend, HP is announcing today that it will separate its PC and printer division from its enterprise and services business. The split means current CEO Meg Whitman will become the chairman of the PC and printer operation, and continue as CEO of the split-off enterprise business. Dion Weisler, an executive at HP\u2019s PC business, will take over as CEO of the company\u2019s PC and printer operation.\n\nHP Enterprise is the newly split-off part of the original company, and HP Inc will continue to focus on PCs and printers. \"The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan,\" says HP CEO Meg Whitman. \"It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders.\" HP is planning to complete the split by the end of fiscal 2015, and the structure will mean the company's total planned layoffs will rise to 55,000 from an earlier estimate of 45,000 to 50,000 cuts.\n\nToday\u2019s split is a significant change for the company, following rumors from 2011 that HP was considering a similar split at the time. Those reports surfaced shortly before HP appointed Meg Witman as CEO, just 11 months after former CEO Leo Apotheker took over from Mark Hurd after he was forced to resign amidst charges of inappropriate business conduct. Apotheker spearheaded a disastrous acquisition of Autonomy, and failed to capitalize on the company\u2019s purchase of webOS.\n\nWhitman\u2019s era at HP has seen the company struggle to cement a solid position in the industry, leaving Lenovo to dominate PC sales worldwide. Whitman\u2019s initial assessment of the company after around six months left her feeling it was \"too complex and too slow,\" noting it had underinvested in its PC division. Instead of significant investment, Whitman claimed in 2012 that the company had to offer a smartphone, before failing to announce one in 2013. Board members reportedly mulled spinning off the company\u2019s consumer PC business in 2013, but it never happened. HP has recently focused on Android tablets, and even an Android laptop, after describing Microsoft as an \"outright competitor.\"\n\nHP and Microsoft appear to be forming a closer relationship with the launch of new low-cost Stream PCs. Although Lenovo continues to push Windows-based PCs, Microsoft still needs close PC allies as it demonstrated with a $2 billion loan to help Dell go private last year. That particular deal may have angered HP, but the renewed partnership will see Microsoft and HP take on Chromebooks this holiday season. HP is also planning to sell a smartwatch this fall.\n\nA new HP says it will focus on \"new computing experiences\" and technologies like 3D printing. \"As the market leader in printing and personal systems, an independent HP Inc. will be extremely well positioned to deliver that innovation across our traditional markets as well as extend our leadership into new markets like 3-D printing and new computing experiences -- inventing technology that empowers people to create, interact and inspire like never before,\" says Dion Weisler, head of HP's Printing and Personal Systems business.","Here are your Apple rumors and AAPL news items for today:\n\ndaily apple rumors  300x180 Wednesday Apple Rumors: Apple May Be Ready to Buy PathBattery: Apple (AAPL) isn\u2019t happy about the one-day battery life in the Apple Watch, reports 9to5Mac.

(One might also think that it would be the first instinct of a journalist before spreading the news.)\n\nAccording to the communications department of the parent company of McDonald's in Chicago (reliable source, we believe), franchises in question are indeed pizza. Except that \"this is not the McPizza, the product of the 1990s that people are familiar with,\" said the inspector viral communications director for Eastern Canada Jason Patuano, reached by telephone.\n\nWe are told that these two franchises that have the same owner, are an \"isolated incident\" and that McDonald's allows them exceptionally to add items to their menu.

There are plenty of reasons why this deal is just business as usual in Silicon Valley and not the end of days.\n\n1. Friends Buying Friends Acquisitions tend to be chummy affair. For example, Path CEO Dave Morin invested in Hot Potato, a company run by his ski buddy Justin Shaffer, Morin worked for Facebook, Facebook acquired Hot Potato. Karma, another Morin investment, was also acquired by Facebook. And Dave started his career at Apple helping give out iPods on college campuses. See, all in the family.\n\n2. Buying CoolApple, which has $150 billion in cash, has been proven itself willing to buy new fans before with the Beats acquisition. But Path is the opposite of cool, you say. That is true, but Morin has proven himself to be a savvy and popular angel investor. In the interest of succession planning, a source told Valleywag, why wouldn't Apple let Morin rest and vest if it meant young CEOs dropping by Cupertino? \"He's a good exec, he's just a sub-par product person. He did well at Apple and Facebook because they had good products,\" added the source.\n\n3. Messaging ManiaSilicon Valley corporations got smoked by Asian messaging apps. People like to communicate with their friends, who knew? Pando says that's part of Apple's renewed interest in social:\n\nAccording to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apple's newly refreshed Messages app. That doesn't mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebook's $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google.\n\nFacebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user.\n\nPerhaps we'll hear more about the price tag when Morin takes the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt in less than an hour.\n\n4.

carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.\n\"The Iraqi Parliament's National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,\" Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.\n\nHe said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.\n\nThe senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.\n\nThe Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.\n\nEarlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.\n\n\"We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL's control in Al-Baqdadi region,\" the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.\n\nHe noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.\n\nAl-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition's planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.\n\nAl-Zameli underlined that  the coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.\n\n\"There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition's military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),\" he told FNA in January.\n\nHe noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.\n\n\"The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.\n\nHe noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, \"These documents are given to the investigation committee ... and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.\"\n\nAlso in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.\n\n\"The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,\" Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.\n\nHe said the coalition's support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, \"The coalition has not targeted ISIL's main positions in Iraq.\"\n\nIn late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.\n\nMP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.\n\nHe added that the US and the international coalition are \"not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month\".\n\nGharawi added that \"the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.\"\n\nSalahuddin security commission also disclosed that \"unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city\".\n\nAlso in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.\n\n\"The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,\" Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.\n\n\"The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,\" she added.\n\nHababi said that the coalition's precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.\n\nIn late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.\n\nField sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.\n\nIn October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.\n\n\u201cThe US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group - while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition's and the US' claims,\u201d Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.\n\nThe US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.\n\nThe US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.\n\nVideo footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.\n\nThe Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL's deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue.","A real-life zombie cat truly exists! A buried cat clawed his way out of his grave after being left for dead alongside a road in Florida. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay has taken in the miracle cat and hopes to do their best to help save him.\n\nRescuers tell FOX 13 in Tampa Bay that the miracle kitty has severe trauma to his head, has a dead eye, a broken jaw, and other serious injuries.\n\nEllis Hutson is the cat\u2019s owner and says \u201cBart\u201d was hit by a vehicle and left for dead. He buried his beloved cat several days ago and is amazed Bart survived his horrendous ordeal.\n\nBart wound up on a neighbor\u2019s front yard after he dug himself out of the grave. Hutson told rescuers that he was certain he was dead. He has no way of explaining how the buried cat clawed his way out of his grave. When they found the zombie cat alive, he was rushed to the veterinarian hospital.\n\nBart will have an operation, but will lose one eye.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen. Cats don\u2019t just come back to life. Not five days after they\u2019ve been put in the ground,\u201d Hutson\u2019s neighbor said, according to News 96.5.\n\nDoctors at the Humane Society of Tampa Bay are scheduling surgery to save Bart\u2019s life. There\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll make it, but his good luck after fooling everyone into thinking he was dead may be an indicator as to how well he pulls through again!\n\nFOX 13 reports that rescuers tell them they believe Bart may have regained consciousness, dug himself out of the ground, and decided to hide out for a few days. They believe Bart will live, but will lose one of his eyes.\n\nBart is still in good spirits despite being hit by a car then buried alive. He purrs when he gets attention, loves being pet, and acts as though nothing happened. The black-and-white cat is very much a big mess \u2013 covered in dirt and dried up blood. When he gets all fixed up again, he should be good to go.\n\nThe Inquisitr wrote on another animal that was believed dead, but dug itself out of a grave. A hamster was buried in the ground and 24 hours later managed to crawl out.\n\nThe story about a buried cat clawing his way out of his grave is good news for his owner who hated parting with his pet. It\u2019s yet one more story of a cat having nine lives!\n\n[Image via FOX 13]","Much has been said already about how the release of the Apple Watch will be the biggest change in Apple products since the company began selling touchscreen devices. However, Apple's new smartwatch will also bring about a small, albeit interesting change to their retail locations: the installation of safes. Not just small, personal safes like you may have in your closet, but large, professional ones like you often see in traditional jewelry stores. Sources say these forthcoming lockboxes are intended for one thing: to store the high-end Apple Watch Edition timepieces that come in luxurious gold.\n\nSpeaking to 9 to 5 Mac, these sources say that some Apple Stores are already seeing safe installations take place, ahead of the expected April release of the Apple Watch. The safes are expected to be used to securely house the stock of the upscale Apple Watch models, along with the demo units from the floor, overnight when the store is closed, much like the practice at jewelry retailers.\n\nOf course, any old \"normal\" safes would be fit for Apple and their premium goods. The safes Apple Stores will be getting are said to be custom-designed, and feature installed MagSafe chargers for the Apple Watch, which will keep the demo units ready for display the following day.\n\nWe're still awaiting an announcement from Apple about the pricing of the Apple Watch. The company previously revealed that the base model wearable in aluminum will have a starting price of $349, but the higher end stainless steel and Edition models are still anyone's guess. Because the Edition model is set to feature yellow or rose gold, it is expected to be priced at well into the thousands.\n\nIf Apple didn't feel it needed safes before to hold its top of the line computers, which already cost several thousands in most cases, then it's probably a good bet that the Apple Watch Edition is going to be their most expensive product.","As if women were not subjugated enough already in Saudi Arabia, the nation\u2019s Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice announced yesterday that \u201ctempting eyes\u201d would be subject to veils if deemed inappropriate.\n\nSheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of the Saudi Arabian committee, said in the announcement that, \"The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones. We have the right to do so.\"\n\nThe new ban on well-manufactured facial features is broad enough to lead to some inquiry on the definition of \"tempting eyes.\" Moreover, what is the process by which a woman will be found guilty of having \u201ctempting eyes?\u201d A humorous image can only come to mind with long lines of \u201ctempting eyed women\u201d waiting to be brought before the 1984-esque committee.\n\nAccording to an unnamed journalist in Saudi Arabia, \u201ctempting eyes\u201d could possibly be defined with these stipulations: \"Uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble.\"\n\nThe unnamed journalist went onto say, \"It's so stupid. I don't know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won't be silent.\"\n\nWhile in most Western nations there is harsh divide between Church and State, in Saudi Arabia no such segmentation exists. In March, King Abdullah awarded the committee more than $53 million to continue enforcing their religious dogma via the estimated 3,500 to 4,000 religious police officers, which patrol the streets.\n\nAs King Abdullah nears the end of his reign, there was hope that a younger and more liberal dictator would follow. Prince Naif was recently appointed as the heir to the throne, but after giving his support to the committee, there is little hope that Saudi Arabia will evolve in the human rights department.\n\n\"The committee is supported by all sides,\u201d Naif said. \u201cIt should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee.\"\n\nThe parental \u201cbecause I told you so\u201d argument lacks logic and rationale, but such is the case when a nation resides under monarch rule. It remains unclear how many women will be found or charged with \"tempting eyes,\" but if there is a great enough dissenting voices, public outcry will hopefully have some bearing on the obscene policy.\n\nSource: Assyrian International News Agency","Allegations that Bill Cosby sexually molested several women in his past are now coming out. On Tuesday, a website called Hip Hop Hangover wrote about how allegations are out that Bill molested Raven Symone.

They do this and bring in page views. This time it is working for them because everyone is spreading the news on Facebook. This report says that Raven Symone says that she was drugged and raped years ago. Snopes has also shared that this is a fake story. At this time, Raven Symone has not accused him of anything.\n\nWet Paint shared the news that Janice Dickinson is revealing that Bill Cosby molested her as well. This report is a true one so you never know who will come out next. She says that it happened in 1982 when she was contacted by Cosby about a role. She shared that he gave her wine and a pill. Janice remembers him being over her and waking up the next morning with semen between her legs. She says that she didn't speak out over fear of being labeled. Janice Dickinson is coming forward because she feels like it is the right thing to do now.","Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ +2.00%  plans to break in two, separating its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe company plans to announce the move as early as Monday, the people said. It is expected to be effected as a tax-free distribution of shares to the company\u2019s stockholders next year, one of the people said.\n\nThe move is one H-P and its investors and analysts have long contemplated. It would come amid a wave of breakups and spinoffs at technology companies and in the wider corporate world, underpinned by the idea that companies with a narrower focus perform better. The moves in many cases have been well-received by shareholders\u2014if not actively sought by them.\n\nOn Tuesday, online-auction pioneer eBay Inc. EBAY -0.77%  announced a plan to spin off its PayPal payments-processing unit.

Current lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company, while Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation, is to be CEO of that business, this person said.\n\nIn fiscal 2013, the printing and personal systems group, as it is known, inked $55.9 billion in revenue, about half the Palo Alto, Calif., company\u2019s total. Sales for the operation dropped 7.1% amid fierce competition, compared with a 6.7% decline for the company as a whole.\n\nLast year, H-P lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments, slipping to No. 2 behind China\u2019s Lenovo Group Ltd, according to industry research firm IDC.\n\nH-P, famously founded in a garage in Palo Alto 75 years ago, has been undergoing a multiyear restructuring under Ms. Whitman as the company tries to stem sales declines. Aside from the PC and printer business, the rest of H-P\u2019s revenue comes from selling services and hardware such as servers and data-storage systems to corporations, as well as software and financial services.\n\nH-P\u2019s shares have risen sharply since last year, but are still well below their highs in recent years\u2014and the even loftier levels they reached in the 1990s tech boom. H-P shares increased 2% Friday to $35.20, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $66 billion.\n\nTo combat lower sales and provide lift to its shares, H-P has laid off tens of thousands of employees and cut other costs.\n\nMs. Whitman has sought to push H-P further into growth pockets such as cloud software, but the company has struggled to make headway in such areas.\n\nH-P has also been contemplating big strategic changes lately. Over much of the past year, the company held talks to merge with data-storage giant EMC Corp., but those negotiations, which would have created an industry giant with a market value of roughly $130 billion, recently ended.\n\nWrite to Joann S.

Last Tuesday's ritual was the first time someone of the Jewish faith was adopted by a president. Yair's parents, Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, had first written a letter asking that their seventh son be adopted in 1993, when he was born, reported the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Kirchner called the ceremony \"magical\" and the Tawils a \"marvelous family.\"","Although Joan Rivers went to Yorkville Endoscopy for a routine procedure, her time spent there was anything but routine.\n\nAs RadarOnline.com has previously reported, Rivers\u2019 female ear, nose and throat doctor stepped in once Dr. Lawrence Cohen, Rivers\u2019 gastroenterologist, discovered something on her vocal cords.

Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told Charlie Rose that he was so impressed with Beats Music that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t sleep\u201d after listening to it for the first time. That doesn\u2019t sound like a product Cook would want to completely kill off.\n\nBeats Music also has a neat feature that Apple might want to incorporate into future products. \u201cThe sentence\u201d gives users the opportunity to select music based on their activity or location (think \u201cI\u2019m on a boat\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m on a rooftop and feel like going back in time\u201d).\u201d\n\n\n4. Apple Is Planning A Mysterious New Music Project\niphone, iphone 6, apple, apple keynote, iphone 6 event, iphone photos, iphone 6 plus, iphone pictures, new iphone\n(Getty)\n\nThe Verge notes that there are rumors that Apple is planning a \u201csignificant music announcement\u201d for next year. The shutdown of Beats Music may be the first step towards making that big announcement, whatever it may be.\n\nApple\u2019s other big announcement in the first half of 2015 will be the official release date of the Apple Watch. Perhaps the Apple Watch will be involved in Apple\u2019s next music project in some way, though it is too early to say so with any degree of certainty.\n\n\n\n5.

It does seem odd that Apple would add Beats to the Apple TV one week, and then start shutting down the service a week later. It\u2019s fair to assume that if the rumors are true, and Apple is killing Beats Music, it won\u2019t shut down the service overnight. Expect Apple to give the service a final termination date that\u2019s some distance in the future.","From a reader in Hong Kong:\n\nI was at the uneventful (if tense) Legco [Legislative Council] demonstration on Saturday as well as last night's demonstrations between Causeway Bay and Central.\n\nIt was as much depressing as, ultimately, uplifting. When I was incapacitated by a blast of pepper spray, I somehow found myself being reverse crowd-surfed to a safe area.\n\nThere, a young girl cradled my head and poured water into my eyes. Some others wiped the chemicals off my arms and legs. When they went on to help the next injured person, an old woman kept watch over me, speaking soft Cantonese and plying me with all manner of snacks and drinks. These were complete strangers. Later, when we scrambled to avoid the first tear gas attack, a small band of people committed to staying put and helping the crush of smoke victims climb over the concrete barriers and into safety.\nWhen we felt threatened, we opened umbrellas and raised our hands.\n\nWhen the police decided to retake the street, they sprayed chemicals in our faces, pointed rifles at us, smashed our limbs with batons. While they were throwing tear gas with reckless abandon, our side threw not one rock, not one bottle, not one egg, nothing. None from our side brandished a firearm, a knife, a club, anything at all. I have neither seen nor heard any reports of protesters looting, burning cars, destroying property, or intentionally injuring police.\n\nYoung women felt safe enough to doze off during the lulls. In what other city would tens of thousands of 'rioters' act with such restraint?\n\nThe government warned against the chaos Occupy Central would cause. It's all too clear to me which side is supplying the chaos and which side is conducting itself with dignity. These demonstrations may have been sparked by anger, but they're sustained by compassion and love.\nI have been working around the clock on a non-China-related magazine project (as the time of this post indicates) and will wait until tomorrow to say something more about the consequential events underway in Hong Kong.\n\nIt is of course interesting to note the spread of the \"hands-up/ don't shoot!\" gesture from Ferguson to Hong Kong, but the circumstances in the two places have 100 times more differences than similarities. There are profound differences as well with the other obvious comparison for mass movements among Chinese people, namely the movements throughout China in the summer of 1989.\n\nWhat is happening in Hong Kong is uplifting, for reasons this reader explains\u2014and surprising, for anyone who knows the generally non-politicized nature of Hong Kong.\n\nBut it is also quite a sobering time, as soon as you think about the options open to the PRC government in Beijing, and the instincts it has displayed in the face of all recent challenges of this sort. Beyond question, this is a challenge that the still-relatively new government of \"Mr. 11,\" Xi Jinping, has brought upon himself. That doesn't mean that it will end nicely.\n\nMore tomorrow, and overnight good wishes to those driven to such unexpected expressions in Hong Kong.","KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 An Afghan mother has become a hero among some of her countrymen after allegedly fighting the Taliban militants who had just killed her policeman son.\n\nReza Gul, a resident of Balabolok district of western Farah province, said she rushed to the small police outpost near her home after it came under attack early on November 17.\n\nShe told NBC News she screamed in anger and grief when she saw her son Safiullah \u2014 who had been guarding the outpost along with a group of lightly armed policemen \u2014 shot dead. Then, she said, she took action.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban attacked our village and my son\u2019s outpost at dawn,\" explained Gul, who like many in Afghanistan does not know her exact age but who estimates she is between 50 and 60. \u201cAfter seeing my young son\u2019s body I picked up his gun and decided to fight off the killers of my son until I die.\u201d\n\nGul spoke to NBC News by telephone from Farah, the capital of Farah Province. NBC News could not independently confirm Gul\u2019s account, although local police and media repeated similar versions of the incident.\n\n\u201cI fought them until dark along with other boys from the police, and [we] killed at least 25 of them,\u201d she added, saying that her husband, daughter-in-law, daughter and her teenage son also joined in and supplied her with ammunition.\n\nGul's daughter, Fatima, told Afghan television channel Tolo News that she had prepared bullets for her father and mother to fight.\n\n\"We started a kind of family war against the Taliban,\" she said.\n\nGul's daughter-in-law Seema told Tolo News that the fighting intensified when she reached the battlefield armed with a variety of light and heavy weapons, but that \"we were committed to fight until the last bullet.\"\n\nProvincial police chief General Abdul Razaq Yaqoobi confirmed that the Taliban had launched a heavy assault on Balabolok district on November 17 with an estimated 400 fighters.\n\n\"The police post in Abdul Satar village which was manned by 10 local police and commanded by a local police officer named Safiullah came under heavy shelling and the commander was killed in the gun battle,\" he said.\n\nHe added that Safiullah\u2019s mother had joined the policemen after learning of her son's death and taken up his rifle. The mother's presence boosted the morale of policemen resisting the attack, Yaqoobi said, and after seven hours of heavy fighting the Taliban fled. At least 25 Taliban militants were killed and 31 injured in that village alone, Yaqoobi added.\n\nNews of Reza Gul fighting the Taliban lit up Afghan social media, with some comparing her to the legendary female folk hero Malalai of Maiwand, who allegedly rallied fighters against the British during the second Anglo-Afghan war of 1879.","A man was tossed off a flight at LaGuardia this week after he freaked out when workers wished him a Merry Christmas.

The man reportedly replied, \"You shouldn\u2019t say that because not everyone celebrates Christmas,\" and snapped at her before boarding the plane.\nThen, Ebenezer 2.0 flipped out at a flight attendant who wished him a \"Merry Christmas,\" whereupon he began \"lecturing the attendants and the pilot about their faux pas,\" according to the tabloid.

(Alex Ogle/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhile the article did note that \u201cit\u2019s impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to Ferguson,\u201d it concluded contending that \u201cit\u2019s fascinating to see a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America become a symbol of democracy and freedom halfway around the world, however it got there.\u201d\n\nOther similar stories followed soon after. MSNBC published an article Monday titled, \u201cIn Hong Kong, protesters say \u2018hands up, don\u2019t shoot!\u2019\u201d The Daily Mail published a story saying that protesters in Hong Kong had copied the gesture used by U.S. demonstrators.\n\nBut, a story in Quartz Sunday appeared to challenge the idea that the gesture used by Hong Kong demonstrators was linked to Ferguson.\n\nAccording to the story, the gesture used by those in Hong Kong was not a deliberate show of solidarity:\n\nMost Hong Kong protesters aren\u2019t purposefully mimicking \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot,\u201das some have suggested. Instead, the gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders, who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful intentions to police.\n\nAsked about any link between the gesture and Ferguson, Icy Ng, a 22-year-old design student at Hong Kong Polytechnic University said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. We have our hands up for showing both the police and media that we have no weapons in our hands.\u201d Ng had not heard of the Ferguson protests. Another demonstrator, with the pro-democracy group Occupy Central, Ellie Ng said the gesture had nothing to do with Ferguson and is intended to demonstrate that \u201cHong Kong protesters are peaceful, unarmed, and mild.\u201d (A more important symbol for the movement may be the umbrella, which protesters have been using to protect themselves against pepper spray and tear gas.)\n\nThe Washington Post followed up Monday with a similar analysis:\n\nSunday, Max Fisher wrote a story for Vox.com arguing that the \u2018hands up don\u2019t shoot\u2019 gesture had spread from protests in Ferguson to the pro-democracy demonstrations on the streets of Hong Kong. However, another writer at Quartz.com, who has actually interviewed protesters, says that this is wrong. The evidence seems to show that the gesture had probably not in fact \u2018spread\u2019 as Fisher and other commentators believed. Instead, the activists organizing the protests appear to have independently chosen to hold their hands up to emphasize their peaceful intentions to police.\n\nVox later corrected their post, addressing the controversy.\n\n\u201cStill, Hong Kongers pride themselves on being plugged in to the world, so it is within the realm of possibility that some of them followed the events in Ferguson and are now appropriating the gesture for their own use, even if only subconsciously,\u201d their story now argues.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) on Twitter","Joan Rivers\u2019 ear-nose-and-throat doctor took a selfie while the comedian was under sedation and began an unplanned biopsy on her vocal cords before the 81-year-old went into cardiac arrest, CNN reported.\n\nA staff member at the Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic in New York told investigators about the picture-taking, according to a source CNN described as close to the death investigation.\n\nThe physician hasn\u2019t been identified.","American hostage Steven Sotloff has reportedly been executed by jihadist terrorists.

People will believe it because it dovetails seamlessly with Apple's obsession with detail and quality. And the circumstantial evidence leading up the story (told in full, below) is that Cook does indeed personally read the email he gets each day from customers. \"I get hundreds, and some days thousands of emails from customers. This is a privilege because they talk to you as if you're sitting at their kitchen table,\" he once told NBC, according to Apple Insider.\n\nThe rap against Cook is that while he might be a good CEO, he may not be the great, visionary CEO that Apple needs. Recently, however, with Apple gearing up to release two large-format iPhone 6 models, an iWatch wearable device and \u2014 possibly \u2014 some sort of push into healthcare or an extension of Apple TV's capabilities, Cook is looking more and more like The Man.\n\nPart of the case in favor of Cook is not that he is a ranting visionary who can rouse the masses like founder Steve Jobs. Rather, it's that he's a super-manager who can make all the different arms of Apple's now-vast empire work together like Swiss (smart)watch.\n\nSo the idea that he would reach down into the company's bowels to tweak the way the on-hold muzak sounds when people call up for help sounds exactly like something this super-manager would do.\n\nHere's what Reddit user \"lerde\" wrote:\n\nI once sent Tim an email about the quality of music while on hold with Apple. It was super low quality, therefore an upbeat rock song sounded like pure distortion and really aggravated me because I was on hold for 20+ minutes for something so simple (iPhone didn't turn on, needed to set up a repair as in my country no Apple Store = have to send it to another country).\n\nMuch to my surprise a lady from Cupertino called me up the next day, saying she'd received a concerning email from Tim about ugly distortion hold music while on the phone, that Tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done. She assured me that the hold music would be tested to make sure it sounded pleasant on all types of phones and connections.\n\nThe next time I called Apple, the hold music was indeed very pleasant.\n\nSEE ALSO:  Delay Of Large iPhone Is The Best Possible News For Samsung","There have already been been numerous reports that US led coalition planes have been air dropping supplies and

senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIraqi Army Downs Two UK Planes Carrying Weapons for ISIS\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Iraqi Parliament\u2019s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,\u201d Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.\n\nHe said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.\n\nThe senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.\n\nThe Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.\n\nEarlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL\u2019s control in Al-Baqdadi region,\u201d the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.\n\nHe noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.\n\nAl-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition\u2019s planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.\n\nAl-Zameli underlined that the coalition is the main cause of ISIL\u2019s survival in Iraq.\n\n\u201cThere are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition\u2019s military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),\u201d he told FNA in January.\n\nHe noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.\n\n\u201cThe US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.\n\nHe noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, \u201cThese documents are given to the investigation committee \u2026 and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.\u201d\n\nAlso in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL\u2019s survival in Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,\u201d Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.\n\nHe said the coalition\u2019s support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, \u201cThe coalition has not targeted ISIL\u2019s main positions in Iraq.\u201d\n\nIn late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.\n\nMP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.\n\nHe added that the US and the international coalition are \u201cnot serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month\u201d.\n\nGharawi added that \u201cthe US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.\u201d\n\nSalahuddin security commission also disclosed that \u201cunknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city\u201d.\n\nAlso in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.\n\n\u201cThe international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,\u201d Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.\n\n\u201cThe ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,\u201d she added.\n\nHababi said that the coalition\u2019s precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.\n\nIn late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.\n\nField sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.\n\nIn October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.\n\n\u201cThe US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group \u2013 while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition\u2019s and the US\u2019 claims,\u201d Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.\n\nThe US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.\n\nThe US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.\n\nVideo footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.\n\nThe Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL\u2019s deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue.","A marine biologist has killed off claims that a giant crab is living on the Kent coast - insisting the image is probably a well-doctored hoax.\n\nResidents of Whitstable were left shocked when a photo emerged appearing to show a huge crustacean just yards from the coastal town's harbour.\n\nBut sea-life expert Dr Verity Nye, who has worked on logging new species of crab, says it is impossible one of the creatures could grow so big.\n\nThis image of Whistable harbour from above led to claims that a 'Crabzilla' could be living off the Kent coast\n\nThe image (left) appears to show a crustacean the length of five or six boats lurking in the Thames Estuary, but marine biologist Dr Verity Nye (right) says the picture is a hoax\n\nDr Nye, an Ocean and Earth Science researcher at the University of Southampton, said: 'The idea of a giant \"crabzilla\" would very exciting.

This dumb video may not be real, but the problem is, and it's a good way to remind potential catcallers of the inherent grossness of their actions.","The son of a North Korean aide linked to Kim Jong-un's executed uncle is believed to be on the run in France after evading abduction by agents of the communist regime.\n\nAccording to diplomatic sources, the man - identified only by his surname Han - has escaped detection amid fears he may be forcibly taken back to the secretive nation to be executed.\n\nThe architecture student has ties to Kim Jong-un's uncle, Jang Song-thaek, the regime's former second in command who was executed for treason in December 2013.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nThe student disappeared after his father was executed by the regime led by Kim-Jong-Un (pictured)\n\nHe disappeared last month while studying at Paris' prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette and speculation was rife as to whether the student had been captured or was hiding out in France.\n\nBut now a diplomatic source has revealed that despite attempts to force Han to return to North Korea, the student has evaded capture as is 'somewhere in France', The Telegraph reported.\n\nPark Sung-jin, Paris correspondent for Yonhap, South Korea's biggest news agency which broke the story, told the newspaper: 'Since the 1980s, when the regime changes and someone is executed and his relatives and friends and family are studying abroad, they are brought home.\n\n'If Han returned he would likely be kept in a political prison or executed. That has happened many times. He knew what was awaiting him, so he escaped.'\n\nHan disappeared last month while studying at the prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette (pictured)\n\nThere are fears that the student may be forcibly taken back to the North Korea to be executed (pictured, Kim Jong-Un during a ceremony for officials and personnel in the fishery field of the Korean People's Army)\n\nHan is the son of one of Jang Song-thaek's closest aides. His father is known to have been 'purged' recently as Kim attempts to reassert his authority after disappearing himself this summer.\n\nThe student had been enrolled at the French school since 2011 along with nine other students who were invited to join by the French government.\n\nThe disappearance comes amid high tensions between the U.S. and North Korea in the wake of the Sony Entertainment hacking scandal and the release of The Interview, a film about the assassination of Kim Jong-un.\n\nAs with most western nations, North Korea has no official ties with Paris, but maintains a small delegation to deal with limited economic negotiations.\n\nHowever, what few relations the two nations do have risk being damaged further if it transpires Han is being sheltered by French authorities.\n\nJang, Kim Jong-un's mentor, second in command, and uncle, was executed for treason last December after being accused of planning a coup.\n\nJang Song-thaek, Kim's uncle and mentor was purged last December after being accused of a coup. Han is reported to have links to Jang, as his father was one of Jang's advisors\n\nAccording to reports the student may have escaped his captors, but it is not known if he was recaptured or if he is hiding somewhere in France (Kim Jong-un pictured on a visit to a fish factory in North Korea)\n\nIn a statement at the time, Pyongyang called Jang Song Thaek a 'traitor to the nation for all ages,' 'worse than a dog' and 'despicable human scum'.\n\nSince then, potentially hundreds of supporters and relatives have been rounded up and either executed or sent to labour camps as Kim has sought to wipe the Jang family out.\n\nThere were thoughts that Kim could have been deposed himself this summer after he was pictured limping at a state event, before going missing for several weeks.\n\nHowever he was soon back in the spotlight and officials said he had gone missing in order to have a cyst removed from his ankle.","Several Nigerian media outlets have been reporting on local women in the villages of Attagara and Kawuri in Borno State who recently disarmed nearly a dozen Boko Haram terrorists. The notorious pseudo-Islamic terror groups tried to attack the Attagara and Kawuri communities over the weekend but the insurgents were instantly repelled by a group of armed women.\n\nThe Attagara and Kawuri villages in Gwoza and Bama Local Government Areas of Borno State resisted the attack using an array of local talismans and, of course, their assault weapons came in handy as well.\n\nAlmost immediately, the community rallied round to apprehend the insurgents. At least three of the terrorists managed to flee, but community members say that seven were arrested and executed.\n\n\n\n\n?\nLocal residents said that the initial attack happened when the terrorists that the villagers described as Boko Haram came into town on motorcycles. Stories are already building up in the aftermath of the victory, as some locals claim that the men were paralyzed by local talismans protecting the initial women who the men encountered.\n\nThe initial women were said to have then gone to their local militia which included a number of armed women, who promptly raced to the scene, repelled and executed the attackers.\n\nMamman Yakubu, a youth that participated in the resistance, said that they killed the terrorists because Boko Haram members never talk when interrogated, and they did not want to risk any of them getting away.\n\nThis is not the only time that Boko Haram has been repelled by local resistance. Just this month, about 200 of the militants were killed during the fighting in the Kala-Balge district of Borno state as well.","Lately, Apple cEO has been making the rounds in Europe, stopping at various stores and chatting with employees.

while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,\u201d Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.\n\nHe said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.\n\nThe senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.\n\nThe Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.\n\nEarlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from

his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.\n\n\u201cThe US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.\n\nHe noted

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader the so-called Islamic State, is said to be among those targeted\n\nSpeculation is mounting that the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was indeed killed in a US led airstrike on Friday.\n\nOn Sunday senior Iraqi officials confirmed that the leader of the Islamic State group was at the very least wounded in the coalition attack and said that the terror chief's right hand man, Auf Abdulrahman Elefery, had perished during the aerial assault.\n\nElefery, who is known by his code name Abu Suja, died when planes hit an ISIS convoy near Mosul in northern Iraq.\n\nHowever, conflicting reports surround the fate of Baghdadi.\n\nISIS members have taken to social media to claim that he was not traveling in the same convoy that claimed Elefery's life, while other sources have stated that the feared warlord was killed or seriously injured in the airstrike.\n\nAn Iraqi security official, Hisham al-Hashimi, told the UK's Daily Telegraph that Elefery was 'Baghdadi's very close companion' and was killed in the attack which destroyed up to 10 vehicles.\n\n'He and Baghdadi were rarely separate. It's for this reason that it could be possible that Baghdadi was with him at the time of the attack,' he said to the British newspaper.\n\nHashimi revealed that Elefery's death was confirmed to him by relatives.\n\nGeneral Nicholas Houghton, the Chief of the Defence Staff of the British Armed Forces told the Daily Telegraph: 'I can't absolutely confirm that Baghdadi has been killed. Probably it will take some days to have absolute confirmation.'\n\nScroll Down for Video\n\nAttacks: Two strikes were reported, one at al-Qaim, near the Syria-Iraq border, and a second in the ISIS stronghold of Mosul\n\nAn Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press that al-Baghdadi was hit during a meeting Saturday with militants in the town of Qaim in Iraq's western Anbar province.\n\nThe official, citing informants within the militant group, said the strikes wounded al-Baghdadi. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.\n\nNeither knew the extent of al-Baghdadi's apparent injuries. Both spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential material. State television later also reported that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.\n\nHowever, Pentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such a strike or al-Baghdadi being wounded.\n\nAl-Baghdadi, an ambitious Iraqi militant believed to be in his early 40s, has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head.\n\nSince taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al-Qaida into an independent transnational military force, positioning himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community.\n\nA U.S.-led coalition has been launching airstrikes on Islamic State militants and facilities in Iraq and Syria for months as part of an effort to give Iraqi forces the time and space to mount a more effective offensive.\n\nThe Islamic State had gained ground across northern and western Iraq in a lightning advance in June and July, causing several of Iraq's army and police divisions to fall into disarray.\n\nPrisoner: al-Baghdadi, shown before his rise to power, was held as a prisoner by the U.S. during the occupation of Iraq\n\nOn Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, including into Anbar province, where fighting with Islamic State militants has been fierce.\n\nThe plan could boost the total number of American troops in Iraq to 3,100. There now are about 1,400 U.S. troops in Iraq, out of the 1,600 previously authorized.\n\nTwo witnesses confirmed that bombs had fallen on the town of al-Qaim, next to the Syrian border.\n\nLocal government sources described how an aircraft had swooped over a meeting of senior ISIS figures and dropped its payload, killing more than a dozen people.\n\nAnother witness said that eight people had died when a bomb struck a market.\n\nA local hospital was said to be overwhelmed with the volume of patients from the raid - including al-Baghdadi.\n\nLocal ISIS officials were reportedly roaming the streets with loudspeakers ordering residents to donate blood to help the wounded.\n\nStriking Baghdadi would be the most significant blow yet in the campaign against ISIS, who have been defiant in the face of sustained air attacks from the U.S. Air Force and allies.\n\nA provincial leader from Anbar in western Iraq, as well as his deputy, are said to be among those killed instantly by the bombs.\n\nAl-Qaim and the neighbouring Syrian town of Albukamal are on a strategic supply route linking territory held by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAir strikes: The reports say that U.S. warplanes dropped bombs on the town of al-Qaim in Iraq. Pictured is an earlier strike against ISIS in Kobani, on the Turkey-Syria border\n\nThe so-called Caliph, who declared himself leader of all the world's Muslims in a televised speech, was formerly a prisoner of the U.S. during their occupation of Iraq.\n\nThe shady figure was eventually released, and rose through the ranks of the jihadist groups which eventually united to form ISIS, or the Islamic State.\n\nIraqi security officials could not immediately comment on the reported raid. The U.S. military did not confirm or deny the strike.\n\nSeparately, the coalition of air forces, which includes Great Britain's RAF and Canadian fighter planes, struck a convoy just outside Mosul, ISIS's stronghold city in northern Iraq.\n\nU.S. officials would not confirm or deny whether Baghdadi, the group's overall leader, had been targeted, though one said that the coalition's airstrikes had not been targeting any particular meeting.\n\nIS-affiliated Twitter accounts rushed to deny the reports, with one tweeting: 'I can report to the Muslims that Amir Al-Momineen Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi Hafid hu'allah is alive and well.'\n\nThe hardline Sunni Islamic State's drive to form a caliphate in the two countries has helped return sectarian violence in Iraq to the dark days of 2006-2007, the peak of its civil war.\n\nIt has also created a cross-border sanctuary for Arab militants, as well as foreign fighters whose passports could allow them to evade detection in Western airports.\n\nThe U.S. strikes coincide with violence elsewhere in Iraq, after jihadist-style attacks hit the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.\n\nA view of the Syrian town of Kobani (Ayn al-Arab) where clashes between ISIL militants and Kurdish armed groups continue, on November 07, 2014\n\nOn Saturday night a car bomb killed eight people in Baghdad's mostly Shi'ite Sadr City, police and hospital sources said.\n\nThe blasts bring to 28 the day's toll from bombs in the Iraqi capital and the western city of Ramadi.\n\nTwo bombs exploded in separate attacks in Baghdad's mainly Shi'ite Amil district, said a police source.\n\n'A driver parked his car and went to a cigarette stall, then he disappeared. Then his car blew up, killing passers-by,' the source said, describing one of the two attacks in Amil.\n\nIn the mostly Shi'ite al-Amin area of Baghdad, another car bomb killed eight people, medical sources said.\n\nThe attack by a suicide bomber on a checkpoint in Ramadi in Anbar killed five soldiers. 'Before the explosion, the checkpoint was targeted with several mortar rounds. Then the suicide humvee bomber attacked it,' said a police official.\n\nThere was no claim of responsibility for the bombings, but they resembled operations carried out by Islamic militants.\n\nIn the town of Baquba, 40 miles northeast of Baghdad, a gunman killed a Shi'ite militiaman, and a car bomb targeting a police officer killed his 10-year-old son, security sources said.\n\nWestern and Iraqi officials say U.S.-led air strikes are not enough to defeat the al Qaeda offshoot and Iraq must improve the performance of its security forces to eliminate the threat from the group, which wants to redraw the map of the Middle East.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has approved sending up to 1,500 more troops to Iraq, roughly doubling the number of U.S. forces on the ground, to advise and retrain Iraqis in their battle against Islamic State.\n\nThe Iraqi prime minister's media office said the additional U.S. trainers were welcome but the move, five months after Islamic State seized much of northern Iraq, was belated, state television reported.\n\nAbu Bakr Al-Baghdadi is the relatively discreet leader of the Islamic State extremist group.\n\nHe used to play for his mosque's soccer team and has a PhD in Islamic history.\n\nBut after spending four years in a US camp during the Iraq occupation, he emerged as one of the most brutal terrorists in the world.\n\nThe government placed a $10 million bounty on his head in 2011 when intelligence identified his movements as critically dangerous.\n\nThis warrant was publicized once more following the beheadings of US nationals James Foley and Steven Sotloff as well as Britons David Haines and Alan Henning.\n\nHe maintained a low profile for months as ISIS, the group's original name, rose to global infamy and Al Qaeda denounced them as 'too extreme'.\n\nBut he finally revealed himself to the public with a speech, filmed and posted on YouTube, in the first week of July this year.\n\nBorn Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri al-Samarri in 1971 near Samarra, Iraq, he came from a Sufi family - a tolerant form of Islam.\n\nIn the 1990s, he completed a PhD in Baghdad and played soccer with friends.\n\nBut he fell out with mosque leaders and fled to Anbar province where he joined Sunni groups protesting the US occupation.\n\nAmerican forces detained Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2005 shortly after the Iraq invasion. He was released when the camp closed in 2009.\n\nHe was thought to be 'bad but not the worst' sources told The Daily Beast.\n\nBut he then joined the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria, and rose up the ranks rapidly.\n\nAfter allegedly killing the leader, Abu Omar Baghdadi, he took hold of the terror group.\n\nThe United States spent $25billion on the Iraqi military during the U.S. occupation that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 and triggered an insurgency that included al Qaeda.\n\nWashington wants Iraq's Shi'ite-led government to revive an alliance with Sunni tribesmen in Anbar province which helped U.S. Marines defeat al Qaeda.\n\nSuch an alliance would face a more formidable enemy in Islamic State, which has more firepower and funding.\n\nPolice Colonel Shaaban Barazan al-Ubaidi, commander of a rapid reaction force in Anbar, said security forces retook eight villages. His account could not be immediately confirmed.\n\nWhy evil ISIS boss al-Baghdadi may be FAKING his own death in a Homeland-style plot to dupe the West\n\nIn the Channel 4 series, the Taliban mastermind battling CIA station chief Carrie Mathieson (pictured) is very much alive, pulling the strings from his perfect hiding place and spinning a web of lies to dupe the Americans\n\nThe \u2018kill mission\u2019 against Islamic State boss Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi carries chilling echoes of TV show Homeland where the chief terror suspect Haissam Haqqani is supposedly killed in a drone attack.\n\nIn the Channel 4 series, the Taliban mastermind battling CIA station chief Carrie Mathieson is very much alive, pulling the insurgent strings from his perfect hiding place and spinning a web of lies to dupe the Americans.\n\nI wonder if al-Baghdadi is doing the same. It would certainly suit him to play dead for a while - plus, he's risen from beyond the grave before.\n\nEven now, the Pentagon is seeking to confirm whether coalition air strikes have critically injured or even managed to kill the elusive \u2018caliph\u2019 \u2013 and we are none the wiser.\n\nCould it be telling that the news of his death apparently leaked out from ISIS itself?\n\nSo far, U.S. officials are working on inference.\n\nLate on Friday night, American warplanes hit a ten-car convoy southwest of Mosul, which functions as ISIS\u2019s capital in northern Iraq.\n\nAmong the 20 people thought to have been killed was Auf Abdulrahman Elefery, who is known by his code name Abu Sajar, a key aide to Baghdadi.\n\nIf Abu Sajar was there, it is likely that Baghdadi was too, though he may also be among the casualties who were rushed to Mosul hospitals, where there were urgent appeals over loudspeakers for blood donations.\n\nAccording to Iraqi sources, parallel attacks on Qaim in Anbar province killed one of the terror group's top strategists in a predominantly Sunni region where ISIS has made huge military advances in recent weeks as the world\u2019s attention was distracted by its relentless siege of Kobane in northern Syria.\n\nNormally so effusive on social media, ISIS are being strangely coy about the losses it may have sustained this weekend, though it has started arresting former members of the Iraqi army lest they are providing the US with actionable intelligence.\n\nISIS is probably scouring their deep substitute bench for replacements for anyone killed, including Baghdadi himself.\n\nBaghdadi has made a lifelong virtue of anonymity, especially since his Al Qaeda mentor, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. bombing raid in 2006.\n\nExcept for his brief appearance in Mosul in July to proclaim himself Caliph (an office that fuses political and religious leadership), Baghdadi has kept a low profile, so that the fate of ISIS does not appear to hinge on his personal survival.\n\nIt also offers the perfect cover should Baghdadi wish to disappear for a while, Homeland-style.\n\nFor Baghdadi has been careful to organize ISIS in such a way that power is highly decentralised, with a clear division between those responsible for administering territories the terror group controls and those who direct its military operations.\n\nISIS has been careful to include many Sunni tribal figures in administration, precisely to pre-empt any U.S. attempt to trigger a tribal uprising against them, a strategy the Americans pursued against Al Qaeda in Iraq (ISIS\u2019s forerunner) in 2007-08 with some success.\n\nTargeted: Baghdadi was reportedly wounded on Friday night when American warplanes hit a ten-car ISIS convoy like this one southwest of Mosul, which functions as ISIS's capital in northern Iraq (file picture)\n\nISIS\u2019s military command includes at least two Sunni Muslim Iraqi army generals on the run since the Saddam era, who clearly have considerable tactical ability.\n\nISIS has used lightning advances and exemplary terror as well as suicide bombers to destroy enemy command and control centres.\n\nThey also use the destruction of bridges and controlled flooding to shape battlefields to their choosing, and the deployment of roadside bombs and embedded tanks to inhibit countermoves by their Iraqi or Kurdish opponents.\n\nSo far, the U.S. response has been to remove the unpopular Shia prime minister of Iraq, to reduce the alienation of the country\u2019s Sunni and limited efforts to restore the fighting morale of the Iraqi national army, which, poorly led, effectively fled from this ferocious opponent.\n\nThe only effective obstacles to ISIS taking over the country have been Shia militias in Baghdad and further south, and the Kurdish peshmerga in the north.\n\nAlthough the U.S. has added a further 1,500 military advisers, bringing their total strength to over 3000, they have to be careful since the same Shia militias are restive about a renewed U.S. \u2018occupation\u2019 of Iraq.\n\nAmerican airstrikes have been criticised as a drizzle when what is required resembles a cloud burst in a thunder storm.\n\nSo far there have been an average of five strikes a day, compared with 50 in Libya in 2011, 85 in Afghanistan, and 800 a day in Iraq itself during the 2003 US-led invasion.\n\nSo far, only 800 of the 3, 200 sorties over Iraq and Syria have actually involved dropping bombs or firing missiles.\n\nUntil these raids at the weekend, there has been an absence of actionable intelligence from the ground, while Pentagon lawyers are being ultra cautious about avoiding any civilian casualties.\n\nThe long distance planes have to fly from bases in Qatar or the UAE, or from carriers in the Persian Gulf, also makes it hard for them to loiter looking for targets of opportunity.\n\nSo while it would be a significant blow to ISIS to lose its self-styled Caliph, he is replaceable in what in practice is a collective leadership with many experienced and hardened personalities. And he may yet rise from \u2018the dead\u2019.","Despite a wild report on a website dedicated to conspiracy theories, local soldiers haven't lost a low-yield nuclear weapon.\n\nAs the lockdown of soldiers in a Fort Carson battalion dragged into its fifth day Monday, the site Whatdoesitmean.com reported that a nuclear artillery shell was missing - an item that hasn't been in the Army inventory for 22 years. That story was translated into several languages, including Russian and spread rapidly on the Internet.\n\nPhoto - The modified M9-Beretta pistol used for the Basic Active Shooter Course fires a powder propelled paint cup to provide the most realistic training possible while maintaining the level of safety required for the scenarios, Jan 26.  The course is taught by a 4-man training team from the 610th Security Forces Squadron, Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas.  They came to Dobbins Air Reserve Base to provide this critical training for the 94th Security Forces Squadron and other Dobbins area security personnel.  The two day course provides classroom and tactical instruction to first responders covering several shooting spree scenarios.   (U.S. Air Force photo/ Brad Fallin) + caption\n\nSources at the post told The Gazette that the lockdown involving 100 soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the 66th Armor Regiment is actually for something more mundane - a 9 mm pistol. The Army hasn't officially released details on what spurred the lockdown and search, calling it \"missing government property.\"\n\nThe lockdown started with about 800 soldiers confined to the battalion's buildings on the post. That was reduced over the weekend to about 100 soldiers - a company of troops.\n\nRetired Command Sgt. Maj. Terrance McWilliams, who served as the post's top enlisted soldier, said lockdowns are a common practice commanders use to turn up lost gear.\n\n\"I personally went through it as a 1st sergeant and the longest it took was four days,\" said McWilliams.\n\nThe lockdown was triggered Thursday after the pistol turned up missing in an equipment inventory that followed a training exercise. Post officials ordered a wide search for the missing weapon Thursday, including inspecting cars as they exited the post at gates.\n\nRetired Command Sgt. Maj. John Kurak, who also held Fort Carson's top enlisted post, said a five-day lockdown isn't close to a record for Fort Carson.\n\n\"In Fort Carson's history there have been lockdowns that have lasted months,\" Kurak said, noting that an infantry battalion on there spent three months on lockdown in the late 1980s after a M-16 rifle was lost.\n\nMcWilliams said the first step in the search for the weapon likely was quizzing the soldier who checked it out from the unit's armory for the training exercise. The battalion's soldiers were returning from a training exercise that spanned a wide swath of the 137,000-acre post.\n\nWhen it was determined that the weapon was lost, soldiers were likely sent to scouring training areas in a move called \"hands across Fort Carson\" that sees soldiers walking shoulder-to-shoulder to find the missing weapon.\n\nWhen that didn't bear fruit, soldiers were ordered to remain on duty and on post until the weapon was found - a lockdown.\n\nLong lockdowns like the one that deprived 1st Battalion soldiers of what was a planned four-day weekend, do come to an end.\n\n\"Eventually its going to get to the point where they determine the item is actually lost,\" McWilliams said. \"Then they will determine what actions to take against the person responsible for the item.\"\n\nLosing a weapon can bring stiff consequences in the military, where loss or destruction of government property can be charged as a crime bringing up to a year behind bars.\n\nThe Army spends a lot of time keeping track of pistols, rifles and other \"sensitive\" items. Every training day begins and ends with a sensitive items check, and daily inventories are sent up through the chain of command.\n\n\"If you can't keep track of your equipment, how can you be expected to do more complex tasks?\" Kurak asked.\n\nIn combat, units heading out and returning from stop for a \"boys and toys\" check to make sure all weapons, night vision goggles, laser sights, radios and other items are on hand.\n\n\"Accountability of equipment is a basic and essential function of a unit,\" Kurak said.\n\nWhile the battalion may have lost a pistol, scores of web pages carried the nuclear weapon tale Monday. That story, attributed to unnamed Russian intelligence sources, alleged that a 155 mm artillery-fired nuclear warhead is missing at the post.\n\nThe battalion involved, though, doesn't have artillery. And the W-48 artillery warhead alleged to be missing was pulled from Army bases worldwide in 1992.\n\nWhile the Pikes Peak region is home to a five military bases, it doesn't house nuclear weapons. The closest nuclear arms are atop Air Force intercontinental ballistic missiles at F.E.

The Michael Report has independently verified this information to be highly credible.\n\nWe should note that this information falls in line with what Apple analysts such as KGI Securities\u2019 Ming-Chi Kuo and Oppenheimer\u2019s Andrew Uerkwitz have been predicting for months.

In March, HTC unveiled the One M8 with a so-called \"Duo camera\" setup, which uses a secondary imaging sensor for depth data.\n\nAn interesting startup called Corephotonics, which was profiled by Engadget earlier this year, proposes a different approach. Corephotonics developed a dual-lens module with two distinct focal lengths, effectively negating resolution drops associated with digital zooming. One camera is used for wide shots, while the other is used for close-ups. As an added bonus, the system provides spatial data for 3D imagery due to its lens offset.\n\nWhile speculation, Apple could employ a similar system, or even stitch together image data from both camera modules, to achieve DSLR-quality high-resolution photos. The company has no shortage of patents covering smartphone camera technology, including Lytro-like refocusing, interchangeable modules and interchangeable external lenses.\n\nPerhaps most similar to today's rumor is an invention for a multi-sensor system that gathers luminance and chrominance values separately, processes the data and outputs photos at exceptionally high resolutions with equally high color accuracy.","The militant Islamic State group has released a video in which it claims to have beheaded the captured American journalist Steven Sotloff, according to the SITE Intelligence Group.\n\nIn the video, which lasts for just under three minutes, ISIS murders Sotloff and threatens the life of David Haines, a British citizen.\n\nThe video comes weeks after ISIS released a video in which it beheaded another American journalist, James Foley.

HPQ +6.68%  on Monday said it plans to separate its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, the latest attempt by the technology company to improve its fortunes by breaking itself in two.\n\nThe company will make the split through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders by the end of fiscal 2015.\n\nIf the division goes off as planned, it would give rise to two publicly traded companies, each with more than $50 billion in annual revenue.\n\nH-P also boosted the number of its expected layoffs by 5,000 to 55,000, after identifying \u201cincremental opportunities for reductions.\u201d H-P had previously projected its job cuts to be between 45,000 and 50,000, and it has already shed 36,000 employees under the restructuring program as of the end of the most recent quarter.\n\nA number of big companies, including eBay Inc. EBAY -0.77%  in tech, have chosen to break up lately, in part because of a belief that operations with different growth profiles are best managed as separate entities. H-P, which has suffered sharp sales declines, sees better long-term potential for its corporate hardware and services business than for its printer and PC unit, said one person familiar with the plan.\n\nThe impending move, first reported Sunday by The Wall Street Journal, set off a round of speculation in the industry about whether the separation could lead to more deal making.\n\nThe Journal recently reported that for much of the past year, H-P held talks to merge with data-storage equipment maker EMC Corp. EMC +0.49%  , a deal that would have created an industry giant with a market value of roughly $130 billion. Although the talks recently ended, the separation could pave the way for H-P\u2019s corporate hardware and services business to ultimately be combined with EMC, industry observers said.\n\nThe planned breakup is one that Palo Alto, Calif.-based H-P and its investors have long contemplated. H-P came close to hiving off its PC operation in 2011, when it announced the ill-fated acquisition of U.K. software company Autonomy Corp. H-P said then it was exploring a separation of its PC business, only to decide two months later to hold on to it amid pressure from shareholders, which led to the departure of then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker.\n\nH-P in 1999 spun off Agilent Technologies, A +1.93%  a maker of electronic-testing gear and other hardware. Agilent subsequently announced plans to break itself up.\n\n\nH-P chief Meg Whitman is slated to be chairman of a PC and printer business, while remaining CEO of a separate company selling corporate hardware and services. Associated Press\nIn 2012, under current H-P Chief Executive Meg Whitman, the company reorganized itself to combine the PC business with its more profitable printer operation, helping pave the way for the current plan.\n\nMs. Whitman is slated to be chairman of the PC and printer business, to be known as HP Inc., and CEO of the other company, to be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. Current lead independent director Pat Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company, while Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation, is to be CEO of that business.\n\nH-P, which affirmed its guidance for the year ending Oct. 31, said it expects per-share earnings of $3.83 to $4.03 for fiscal 2015. The range doesn\u2019t include one-time charges expected to be connected to the separation. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were projecting $3.95 a share.\n\nIn the 2013 fiscal year ended last October, the Printing and Personal Systems Group, as it is known, reported $55.9 billion in revenue, about half of H-P\u2019s total. Sales for the operation dropped 7.1% amid fierce competition, compared with a 6.7% decline for company revenue as a whole.\n\nLast year, H-P lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments, slipping to No. 2 behind China\u2019s Lenovo Group Ltd 0992.HK +0.68%  , according to industry research firm IDC.\n\nH-P\u2019s shares have risen sharply since the beginning of last year, but they remain well below their highs in recent years\u2014and the even loftier levels they reached during the 1990s tech boom. H-P shares increased 2% on Friday to $35.20, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $66 billion.\n\nIn response to lower sales and to provide a lift to its shares, H-P has laid off tens of thousands of employees and cut other costs.\n\nMs. Whitman has sought to push H-P further into growth pockets such as \u201ccloud\u201d software, but the company has struggled to make headway in such areas.\n\nThe recent wave of breakups and spinoffs at technology companies and in the wider corporate world has been fueled by the idea that companies with a narrower focus perform better. The moves in many cases have been well-received by shareholders\u2014and sometimes actively sought by them.\n\nLast Tuesday, online-auction pioneer eBay, where Ms. Whitman was once CEO, announced a plan to spin off its PayPal payments-processing unit. Shareholders rewarded eBay\u2019s decision, pushing the company\u2019s shares up about 7.5% that day.\n\n\u2014Shira Ovide and Michael Calia contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Joann S.

Last week, Ginni Rometty, chief executive since 2012, reported quarterly profits below analysts\u2019 forecasts and an 11th straight quarter of falling revenues.\n\nAnnual revenue fell to $93bn (\u00a362bn) last year from $107bn three years earlier as the company shed businesses such as its unprofitable chip design and manufacturing arm. IBM, once an industry pioneer, is still the world\u2019s biggest computer technology company, but it has failed to produce income from consulting, security software and analytics to make up for declining revenues from its old operations.\n\nCringely predicted big cuts in the workforce at IBM\u2019s US mainframe and storage operation that would damage its ability to serve customers. He alleged project chrome was an accounting exercise to flatter IBM\u2019s results with cost cuts while business disappears from the group\u2019s top line.\n\nIBM\u2019s critics have accused the company of managing its results for years using tax-reduction schemes, outsourcing and non-standard accounting to keep earnings growing.

That's until the \"varmala\" ceremony, where the groom garlands his would-be wife, began.\n\nJust as he extended his arms to do that, Kishore had an epileptic fit, falling to the ground in front of the whole gathering.\n\nThe young bride, angry that her family had been kept in the dark about Kishore's medical condition, promptly changed her mind and announced that she would happily marry at the same ceremony a guest at the wedding, a man called Harpal Singh. The latter, incidentally, turned out to be her sister's brother-in-law.\n\nSingh, caught unawares and dressed in jeans and a leather jacket, fumbled for a moment before declaring he would willingly take Indira as his wife. This time the \"varmala\" was exchanged between Singh and Indira, which went off without any hitch, with the pandit reciting the mantras and asking the new couple to take the seven \"pheras\".\n\nMeanwhile, Kishore, who had been rushed to a doctor by his relatives, went back to the venue after he regained consciousness to see that his wife-to-be was now someone else's.\n\nKishore pleaded with Indira, telling her that he would not be able to face friends and neighbours if he returned without her.

That child gets a medal and education up to the age of 21.\n\nUntil 2009, the tradition was only available to Catholics, but Tawil was the first Jewish person to be adopted by the Argentine president, according to the Independent.\n\nBut what Kirchner described as a \"magical moment\" on Twitter has become a hairy situation thanks to some confusion.\n\nIt seems there is another Argentine tradition called \"El Lobison\"; a belief that a family's seventh son turns into a werewolf starting on the first Friday after the boy's 13th birthday, and every full moon thereafter, the New York Daily News.\n\nThe belief was allegedly so widespread in the 19th century that parents would kill the seventh son to prevent a future teenage werewolf.\n\nIt's a great story, but the two customs are not related, according to Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda.\n\n\u201cThe local myth of the lobison is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,\u201d Balmaceda told the Guardian.\n\nThat detail didn't stop the Independent from blending the two separate customs and reporting that Kirchner adopted Tawil to prevent him from becoming a werewolf.\n\nOther media outlets, including UPI.com, the New York Daily News, BuzzFeed and HuffPost UK reported that the president adopted Tamir specifically to keep him from becoming a werewolf.\n\nIt's probably not true, but Kirchner has not commented on the werewolf confusion, and neither has any werewolf.\n\n@media only screen and (min-width : 500px) {.ethanmobile { display: none; }}\n\nLike Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter |   Contact The Author","A RESPECTED senior French police officer investigating the Charlie Hebdo magazine massacre took his own life mere hours after the horrific attacks stunned the world.\n\nCommissioner Helric Fredou, 45, turned a gun on himself in his police office in Limoges last Wednesday night, reported France 3.\n\nA colleague found his body at 1am on Thursday, the day after three gunmen fired at the satirical magazine's office and left 12 people dead.\n\nSpeaking to our sister publication Mirror Online, the Union of Commissioners of the National Police confirmed Mr Fredou had taken his own life.\n\n\nIn a statement released after his death, a union spokesman said: \"It is with great sadness that we were informed this morning of the death of our colleague Helric Fredou, assigned as Deputy Director of the Regional Service Judicial Police in Limoges.\n\n\"On this particular day of national mourning, police commissioners are hit hard by the tragic death of one of their own.\n\n\"The Union of Commissioners of the National Police would like to present its most sincere condolences to the relatives of Helric.\n\n\"In these difficult times, we have a special thought for all his colleagues.\"\n\nMr Fredou - who was single and had no children - began his career as a police officer in 1997, working in Versailles.\n\nHe eventually returned to his home town of Limoges and in 2012 became deputy director of the regional police service.\n\n\nFrench media reports suggest he was depressed and was suffering from burnout.\n\nBrothers Said and Cherif Kouachi launched last Wednesday's devastating attack at the office's of the French satirical magazine.\n\nThe attack left 12 people dead.

But none of those features will make it into the final product due to a variety of issues, according to the Journal. Some features didn't work properly. Others proved too complex. And some would have required regulatory approval. As such, Apple was forced to scale back the range and depth of health features for its first entry into the smartwatch arena, the sources said.\n\nDue out in April, the Apple Watch will enter an already crowded playing field, competing with products from Samsung, Sony, Motorola, Microsoft, LG and others. It's been thought that Apple postponed its release of a smartwatch at least in part to perfect the health and fitness monitoring features. But if the Journal's sources are correct, some of those features proved more challenging than expected.\n\nFor example, the Journal reported, Apple tested sensors to measure skin conductivity, which would have helped monitor stress levels and heart rate. But the sensors ran into inconsistencies with different people, such as those with hairy arms or dry skin, and the results were mixed based on how tightly you wore the watch, according to the Journal's sources.\n\nApple also tested ways to check blood pressure and the level of oxygen in the blood, but again, the results were inconsistent. Further, if those features strayed into the area of actually providing medical advice, they would have required approval from the Food and Drug Administration -- something Apple was trying to avoid.\n\nThe difficulties in creating a smartwatch with such features prompted people at Apple to dub the project a \"black hole\" as it sucked in more and more resources, one of the sources said.\n\nAs a result, Apple has been touting its first smartwatch as more of an all-purpose wearable. Yes, several key health and fitness features will be available and useful, especially as third-party developers create apps to tap into that market. But Apple is also busy promoting other aspects of the watch, including its variety of styles, its ability to act as an adjunct to the iPhone, its support for Apple Pay and its voice-activated controls.\n\nWill those features and the Apple name convince enough consumers to consider the Apple Watch over the competition? In December, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster projected unit sales of 8 million for 2015. Wall Street has been forecasting sales of 12 million to 15 million. Apple has reportedly asked its suppliers to manufacture 5 million to 6 million watches for its first quarter of release.\n\nWhether initial sales are as healthy as expected, Apple will certainly come out with future models. Those could even include some of the health features that didn't pass muster the first time around, the Journal's sources added.\n\nAn Apple spokeswoman told CNET that the company declined to comment on rumor or speculation.","THE scourge of ISIS \u2014 a female Kurdish warrior who was credited with killing 100 jihadists \u2014 may have herself died in the desperate battle to prevent the city of Kobani falling into extremist hands.

for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.\n\n\"The Iraqi Parliament's National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,\" Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.\n\nHe said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.\n\nThe senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.\n\nThe Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.\n\nEarlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.\n\n\"We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL's control in Al-Baqdadi region,\" the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.\n\nHe noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.\n\nAl-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition's planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.\n\nAl-Zameli underlined that  the coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.\n\n\"There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition's military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),\" he told FNA in January.\n\nHe noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.\n\n\"The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.\n\nHe noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, \"These documents are given to the investigation committee ... and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.\"\n\nAlso in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.\n\n\"The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,\" Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.\n\nHe said the coalition's support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, \"The coalition has not targeted ISIL's main positions in Iraq.\"\n\nIn late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.\n\nMP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.\n\nHe added that the US and the international coalition are \"not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month\".\n\nGharawi added that \"the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.\"\n\nSalahuddin security commission also disclosed that \"unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city\".\n\nAlso in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.\n\n\"The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,\" Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.\n\n\"The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,\" she added.\n\nHababi said that the coalition's precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.\n\nIn late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.\n\nField sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.\n\nIn October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.\n\n\u201cThe US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group - while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition's and the US' claims,\u201d Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.\n\nThe US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.\n\nThe US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.\n\nVideo footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.\n\nThe Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL's deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue.","Jihadi John, the Briton who beheaded two British and two American hostages held by Islamic State terrorists, has been injured in a US-led air strike, according to reports received by the Foreign Office.\n\nThe masked \u2018executioner\u2019 with a London accent is believed to have narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit of the group\u2019s leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday.\n\nThe meeting was targeted by American and Iraqi jets.\n\nThe US Air Force attacked a bunker where Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and Jihadi John were meeting in Iraq\n\n\u2018We are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them,\u2019 a Foreign Office spokesman told The Mail on Sunday.\n\nThis newspaper has received an independent account of how Jihadi John was injured and rushed to hospital after a devastating air strike in Al Qaim, in Anbar Province, Western Iraq.\n\nThe Foreign Office spokesman added: \u2018We have a number of sources of information coming in.\n\n\u2018The incident occurred last weekend, and so we have received the reports in the last few days. We don\u2019t have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports.\u2019\n\nThe Foreign Office also issued an official statement saying: \u2018We are aware of reports. We cannot confirm these reports.\u2019 A spokesman for US Central Command said they were unable to confirm the details for security reasons.\n\nThe joint US-Iraqi mission left at least ten IS commanders dead, and around 40 injured.\n\nThose reportedly hurt included IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.\n\nBut until now, Jihadi John\u2019s presence at the meeting has not emerged.\n\nIt is also not known whether Jihadi John was intentionally targeted or merely happened to be present.\n\nThe secret, heavily guarded meeting took place last Saturday in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house in Al Qaim. At least 30 tribal elders from various parts of Syria and Iraq gathered to pledge allegiance to Al-Baghdadi, according to our well-placed Syrian source. He said Jihadi John, as a senior IS figure in his own right, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, was also present.\n\nSources claim that Jihadi John, pictured, was injured and rushed to hospital following the surgical airstrike in Iraq which killed ten ISIS commanders, the killer, who has a London accent, murdered Steven Sotloff\n\nJihadi John was also responsible for the murder of British aid worker Alan Henning, left\n\nAccording to our source, a nurse who treated the wounded in a hospital in Deir-ez-Zour, confirmed that one of the names on the injured list was Jalman, saying it was \u2018the one who slaughtered the journalists\u2019.\n\nIt is not clear how seriously the British fanatic was hurt, but the source said that both he and Al-Baghdadi were rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment.\n\nIS members issued urgent calls through the local mosque\u2019s loudspeakers, appealing for the town\u2019s residents to donate blood at the hospital.\n\nOur source, who does not want to be identified for his own safety, added that Jihadi John, Al-Baghdadi and the other wounded IS personnel were then driven to Syria, and travelling 200 miles north along the Euphrates valley to the IS stronghold of Raqqa.\n\nThe injured were taken to two captured Syrian army barracks near the city in the hope that underground medical facilities there would provide protection against further air strikes.\n\nThe source said that hospitals in Raqqa and nearby Deir-ez-Zour were ordered to take their medical supplies and staff to the secure bases, once the HQs of the Assad regime\u2019s 17th Division and 93rd Brigade.\n\nJihadi John, right, became one of the world's most wanted terrorists after he murdered James Foley, left\n\nJihadi John, who also murdered David Haines, left, is believed to live in the Syrian town of Al Bukamal\n\nJihadi John has become one of the world\u2019s most hunted terrorists after beheading British aid workers David Haines, 44, from Perth, and Alan Henning, 47, from Manchester; and American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31. Footage of the atrocities has been released online, and in the most recent gruesome execution video of Mr Henning, put out last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker.\n\nBritish journalist John Cantlie, also held hostage, has been forced to appear in a series of internet propaganda videos for IS.\n\nOur source, who has contacts with the IS leadership in Syria, also throws fresh light on the role played by Jihadi John within the terrorist group.\n\nUnlike most other western Muslim recruits, he has risen to a position of some seniority. Normally, Western fighters occupy lowly positions, mainly being used as foot soldiers or performing guard duty. Although believed to formerly have been a prison guard for IS, Jihadi John was made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS \u2018wilayat\u2019, or province.\n\nIS is now controlling large areas of Syria and Iraq, which it has declared an Islamic caliphate. Jihadi John is understood to be in the shura council for the wilayat of Al Furat, an area that straddles the Syria-Iraq border and includes Al Qaim, the scene of the air strike.\n\nOur source added that Jihadi John does not live in Raqqa, but in Al Bukamal, a small desert town which borders Iraq.\n\nHe is aged between 28 and 31, and is fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, the language of the Koran, according to our source. He first joined IS in Iraq when he left the UK, but then moved to Syria.\n\nThe raid is believed to have injured the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, pictured\n\nThe source said that Jihadi John usually travels in a black Audi jeep, and he has six other British terrorists with him who act as his bodyguards.\n\nIn the confusion following the bombing last weekend, rumours swiftly spread that IS leader Al-Baghdadi had been killed.\n\nLast week, in order to scotch those rumours, he issued a 17-minute audio recording, exhorting extremists to \u2018erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere\u2019.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday has obtained an Iraqi intelligence document from the Federal Intelligence and Investigation unit of the Ministry of Interior, which outlines last Saturday\u2019s attack.\n\nThe document said that Al-Baghdadi was wearing black and first went to a kindergarten building before going to have lunch at an IS leader\u2019s house. It is believed that the air strikes took place when he was meeting the other leaders in a bunker beneath that property.\n\nIt is understood that Jihadi John has been moved to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in Syria, pictured\n\nMuhammad Nasser Delli, an MP for Anbar province, told The Mail on Sunday that local residents confirmed to him that they saw Al-Baghdadi being treated at Al Qaim.\n\nHe said: \u2018A number of people saw him there, but he did not stay at the hospital long. There were lots of women and children that were killed on Saturday during the air strikes.\u2019\n\nThe Iraqi intelligence paper also states that Al-Baghdadi was taken to Al Qaim hospital, before being driven to Syria.\n\nIt lists 16 IS leaders as having been killed in the attack, and nine injured.\n\nAmong the dead are Abu Huzaifa Al-Adnany, a security guard to Al-Baghdadi, and Abu Quatayba, the cleric of Al Furat wilaya, who would sit in the same shura council as Jihadi John.\n\nAlso dead is a prominent IS fighter from Chechnya called Abu Abdul Rahman Al-Shishani, says the document.","Brain surgery recovery can be a gamble, but not everybody wakes up in the middle of the procedure. Surgeons don\u2019t yet know exactly how the organ works, so it\u2019s always a risk.\n\nIga Jasica, a 19-year-old Polish girl, woke up while it was happening and gave the surgeons a surprise. The reason for the surgery was to remove a tumor which had apparently been bothering her for a while. It is suspected that the surgeons may have triggered neurons which caused her to regain consciousness and the ability to hear and speak, but not the senses of sight and feeling.\n\nIt was also possible that the doctors had given her the anesthetics incorrectly. Fox News claims that investigators are looking into the reason why Jasica spent part of her brain surgery awake. The surgeons may have simply activated the right neurons despite successful administration of anesthesia.\n\nThe surprisingly premature brain surgery recovery is a rare situation, and the surgeons said the first thing she did was ask them, \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\nTeenager wakes up while undergoing BRAIN SURGERY in Poland\u2026 and asks the surgeons how the\u2026 http://t.co/MerFal7GP1 via @MailOnline\n\n\u2014 netdog713 (@netdog713) January 3, 2015\n\nIga Jasica allegedly didn\u2019t appear to wake up in pain, and didn\u2019t sound panicked or frightened. Officials have stated that even though her brain was fully exposed, there was no danger, and her health was not in jeopardy.\n\nThe patient reportedly felt so comfortable that as she chatted with the surgeons, Jasica started talking about cats.\n\nAfter her successful brain surgery recovery, Jasica told the Daily Mail about the experience.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love.\n\n\u201cI missed Christmas because of this operation but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great.\u201d\n\nSpending part of brain surgery awake can be a scary situation, but this time everything turned out fine. It even led to an amusing tale of a 19-year-old girl who got rid of a brain tumor and loves cats.\n\n[Image via The Daily Mirror]","An Islamic State video has appeared which purports to show the beheading of Steven Sotloff, a US journalist being held hostage by the militants.\n\nMr Sotloff disappeared in Syria in 2013. He appeared at the end of a video last month showing fellow US journalist James Foley being killed.\n\nAfter Mr Foley's death, Mr Sotloff's mother appealed to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to save her son's life.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials were checking the reports.\n\nThe US has recently carried out dozens of air strikes against IS targets in Iraq.\n\nBBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the apparent beheading is a way for IS to get back at the US for its actions.\n\nMr Earnest urged caution about the veracity of the video.\n\n\"I'm not in a position to confirm the authenticity of that video or the reports,\" he said.\n\n\"If there is a video that's been released, it's something that will be analysed very carefully by the US government and our intelligence officials to establish its authenticity.\"","The son of an aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s uncle is in hiding in France after evading abduction by agents of the Communist regime, foreign diplomatic sources believe.\n\n\u201cThere was an attempt to force him to go back, but it is thought he escaped and is somewhere in France. There is an attempt to locate him but he hasn\u2019t been found yet,\u201d said the diplomatic source.\n\nThe architecture student, referred to only by his surname Han, went missing last month, raising concerns for his safety. He is believed to be the son of a close confidant of Jang Song-thaek, Kim Jong-un\u2019s once powerful uncle who was executed in December last year on treason charges. Han's father is known to have been killed recently as part of a Kim regime purge of Jang allies.\n\nPark Sung-jin, Paris correspondent for Yonhap, South Korea\u2019s biggest news agency which broke the story, said: \u201cSince the 1980s, when the regime changes and someone is executed and his relatives and friends and family are studying abroad, they are brought home.\n\n\u201cIf Han returned he would likely be kept in a political prison or executed. That has happened many times. He knew what was awaiting him, so he escaped.\u201d\n\nHan\u2019s curious disappearance, which comes amid heightened tensions between North Korea and America over the Sony Entertainment Pictures hacking scandal, has lifted the lid on the murky ties France keeps with the Communist regime.\n\nDespite having no official diplomatic relations with the dictatorship, France has been behind a discreet student programme in place since 2002 in which North Korean students from privileged backgrounds study architecture in Paris. The stated aim is for them to return to Pyongyang and launch grandiose architectural projects to the glory of the dictatorship.\n\nHan was studying at Paris\u2019 prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette. He had left North Korea for Paris in 2012, along with nine other North Koreans, five of whom are posted at another architecture school in Belleville. They are in their third year of a five-year course.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t decide out of the blue to take on students from North Korea, the decision was made by the French culture ministry to whom we answer. This is over our heads,\u201d said a head teacher at the La Villette school, who recalled her surprise when the first batch of students turned up wearing badges with the effigy of their \u201cDear Leader\u201d.\n\nThe students are kept under close surveillance, she told The Telegraph.\n\n\u201cThere is often an Asian man in a three-piece suit waiting in the courtyard, checking up on attendance and if they get good results,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen one failed part of his exam and was sent home, a representative from the North Korean delegation in Paris wanted to take it in his place. We had to explain that wasn\u2019t possible,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter long denying its existence, the French foreign ministry confirmed to The Telegraph that a \u201ccooperation programme\u201d involving \u201cstudents from North Korea trained in architecture in Paris\u201d has been in place for the past decade.\n\nIt had no further comment.\n\nThe programme was set up by Jean-No\u00ebl Juttet, a former French ambassador to Japan, who said he was asked by the French foreign ministry to find ways of \u201cmaintaining contact between the two countries\u201d.\n\nHoming in on education, he said the French suggested courses in \u201cpriority sectors, like medicine, food or construction\u201d but that the North Koreans were only interested in one field: architecture.\n\n\u201cThat was a request that came all the way from the top. They insisted so much that we ended up agreeing,\u201d he told Street Press, an online news site that first uncovered the student programme.\n\nTrained in France, the land of star architects like Jean Nouvel, the students are supposed to help transform Pyongyang\u2019s skyline with new, cutting-edge architectural designs, such as the Ryugyong hotel, a 330-metre high edifice completed in 2012. They have reportedly been behind designs for a new ice skating rink, dolphinarium and sports centre opened last year to help North Korea become a \u201cnew society of leisure\u201d.\n\nArchitecture is not Kim Jong-un\u2019s only area of interest in France. In April, it also emerged that the Emmental-loving despot had ordered three officials to attend a crash course in cheese-making at a dairy school in eastern France - reportedly because he was dissatisfied with his country\u2019s attempts at dairy production. The school politely declined.\n\nFrance has historically kept relatively warm ties with Communist nations, including China. In 2011, it emerged that a French neurosurgeon, Francois-Xavier Roux, had secretly treated Kim Jong-il, the former North Korean leader, in 2008 after he had a stroke.\n\nDescribing Kim as apparently \"profoundly Francophile\u201d, Dr Roux said: \"He wanted to establish political ties with France. He was not hiding that.\n\n\"He also knew French cinema very well. I was pretty surprised. He knew French wines pretty well. We were talking about the differences between Bourgogne and Bordeaux, etc.\"\n\nLast month, it was reported that Pyongyang flew in a French surgeon to operate on Kim Jong-un\u2019s feet after state media pictured him walking with a cane.\n\nBehind the university exchange lies a complex game of parallel diplomacy, according to North Korea expert Pierre Rigoulot.\n\n\u201cFor North Korea, the exchanges are a way of legitimising the Pyongyang regime and receiving recognition. The aim for which they will sacrifice anything is to open an embassy in Paris.

There had previously been reports on social media that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi would make his first public appearance since his Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant changed its name to the Islamic State and declared him caliph. The Iraqi government denied that the video, which carried Friday's date, was credible. It was also not possible to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording or the date when it was made.\n\nIraqi officials said Sunday that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS or Islamic State terror group, was wounded in a U.S.-led airstrike on a convoy of militants in Iraq, and a security strategist said the attack killed his close aide.\n\nWhile Pentagon officials said they cannot confirm whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy that was targeted, Iraq's Defense and Interior Ministries issued statements saying the ISIS leader had been wounded, according to The Associated Press.\n\nAn Iraqi Interior Ministry intelligence official also cited informants within the terror group as saying that the ISIS leader was hit in the town of Qaim in Iraq's western Anbar province.\n\nAuf Abdulrahman Elefery, a \"very close companion\" of al-Baghdadi and also known as Abu Suja, was killed along with several other members of the ISIS when planes struck the group's convoy on Friday night, Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi security strategist, told The Telegraph.\n\n\"He and Baghdadi were rarely separate. It's for this reason that it could be possible that Baghdadi was with him [at the time of the attack],\" al-Hashimi was quoted as saying. \"There are more 20 other people were killed in the US air strike but they are not senior in the organization.\"\n\nBaghdadi was supposedly an Islamic preacher at the time of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. He later became a militant and was briefly detained by American forces at Camp Bucca, according to Defense Department officials.\n\nBaghdadi, who is in his early 40s and has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head, then allegedly met and received training from al-Qaeda operatives, and later became the leader of the ISIS.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes on ISIS positions in Iraq and Syria since August.\n\nOn Friday, U.S.-led airstrikes destroyed a convoy of 10 armed trucks in the attacks on a gathering of ISIS leaders near Mosul.\n\nA Mosul morgue official said about 50 bodies of ISIS militants were brought to the facility after the airstrikes.\n\nThe U.S. has now also doubled the number of its troops in Iraq to fight ISIS militants.\n\nWhile there are about 1,400 U.S. troops in Iraq, President Obama Friday authorized Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to send 1,500 more troops to train and assist Iraqi forces in fighting ISIS militants, as was requested by Iraq's government.\n\nISIS, an al-Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIL, now controls large parts of territories in Iraq and Syria, and seeks to form an Islamic emirate in the Levant region through \"jihad.\"\n\nISIS is seen as the most brutal jihadist terror group. According to reports, U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, who have been beheaded by ISIS militants, were subjected to severe physical torture, including waterboarding, and a majority of them converted to Islam under duress.","A 42-year-old Russian fisherman was being mauled by a brown bear when his Justin Bieber \u201cBaby\u201d ringtone saved his life, he believes.\n\nThe Daily Mail reports that Igor Vorozhbitsyn had parked his car and was walking towards his favorite fishing spot when the bear attacked him and began clawing his face and chest, but then his phone rang, playing the annoying crescendo of \u201cbaby, baby, baby, baby oooh,\u201d and the bear did what any creature with ears would do when it heard Justin Bieber: it fled.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,\u201d he said.\n\nThe man, who sustained cuts and bruises on his face and chest and was taken to the hospital after other fisherman found him, said he firmly believes if his phone hadn\u2019t rang he would have been killed, marking the first time in written history that someone has been thankful for Justin Bieber\u2019s existence.

The law in California, where Manson is incarcerated, grants spousal ownership of remains.\"\n\"He's finally realized that he's been played for a fool ... Manson never consented to the wedding in the first place and never will,\" Simone told The New York Post. \"He feels he will never die,\" Simone said. \"Therefore, he feels it's a stupid idea to begin with,\" the Post reported.\nBurton has not yet commented on her foiled plan.

But, but, but ... we thought it was getting a franchise this year, too.\n\nYeah, the crickets are still competing with all the chirping about that, about how the NHL is increasing from 30 ... to 32 ... to 34 ... or more clubs.\n\nGallagher wrote that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has changed his mind about expansion and is now ready to take the plunge \u2014 and that he doesn't have to stop at just two teams.\n\nThe NHL adding more than two fits historically. This is how the league has operated the past 40-plus years:\n\n1967: Next Six, to join with the Original Six.\n\n1970-74: Six, to continue Western expansion and to compete with the WHA.\n\n1979: Four, as the league absorbed the surviving teams of the dying WHA.\n\n1991-93: Five, as the Sun Belt strategy took hold.\n\n1998-2000: Four, as part of the league's reunion tour (Atlanta, Minnesota, Ohio).\n\nThere are enough worthwhile markets outside Seattle and Las Vegas (Quebec City, Kansas City, Toronto, Hamilton, Portland) to go to 36.

They were located trying to cross at Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls, New York. The soldiers were on a joint military training exercise in Cape Cod before they disappeared this weekend. Officials were never particularly concerned about their disappearance, though, saying they were fully vetted before they arrived in the U.S. The officers arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 11 and were reported missing by base security personnel late Saturday. Two Afghan policemen recently went missing while in Washington, D.C. for a DEA training program; they were found safe somewhere outside D.C.","Was Joan Rivers\u2019 death preventable? New information suggests that Rivers should not have gone into cardiac arrest on that fateful August day. According to Radar Online, Joan\u2019s daughter Melissa is ready to take legal action against the clinic that performed a \u201croutine endoscopy\u201d that went terribly wrong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become very clear to Melissa and experts she has spoken to that her mother didn\u2019t have to die. This was a routine endoscopy that went wrong. Melissa has also been told that staff members at Yorkville Endcoscopy revealed a shocking detail to medical investigators looking into Joan\u2019s death \u2014 something occurred during the procedure that wasn\u2019t medically related.\u201d\n\nJoan Rivers\u2019 death was unexpected, and learning that she didn\u2019t have to die is perhaps the hardest part. Many people suspect that something out of the ordinary happened when Joan was put under for her procedure, especially since her doctor (Dr. Cohen) parted ways with Yorkville Endoscopy right after the incident with Rivers occurred. Sources say that Melissa Rivers wants to wait until she learns her mother\u2019s cause of death before she takes legal action.\n\n\u201cIt was something related to Joan\u2019s personal ear, nose and throat doctor and it wasn\u2019t about the unplanned biopsy she did. Melissa will await the outcome of the official medical investigation and then absolutely file the lawsuits.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNN, staffers at the clinic revealed that Dr. Cohen took a selfie with Joan Rivers while she was under anesthesia. Also, Dr. Cohen reportedly took a biopsy of something that he found during the endoscopy without Rivers\u2019 consent. It very well may have been the biopsy that caused Rivers to stop breathing.\n\n\u201cInvestigators believe that Rivers\u2019 vocal chords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29, the source said.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported by The Inquisitr, Joan was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan after a staff member called 911. Despite resuscitation efforts, Rivers was placed on life support when she was admitted to the hospital. There had been so many rumors about Joan \u201cgetting better\u201d and \u201cpulling through,\u201d but once Melissa confirmed that her mom was on life support, the public sort of figured that things weren\u2019t improving.\n\nRivers passed away on Sept. 4 (exactly one week after being admitted to the hospital) after being taken off life support.\n\n[Photo courtesy of Hampton Roads]","An airstrike has wounded the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, according to Iraqi officials.\n\nPentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such a strike or of al-Baghdadi being wounded.\n\nIraq\u2019s Defence and Interior Ministries issued statements saying al-Baghdadi had been wounded, without giving further detail.\n\nAn Interior Ministry intelligence official said al-Baghdadi was hit during a meeting yesterday with militants in the town of Qaim in Iraq\u2019s western Anbar province.\n\nThe official, citing informants within the militant group, said the strikes wounded al-Baghdadi. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.\n\nMORE: British ISIS fighter, from Derby, killed in Iraq\n\nNeither knew the extent of al-Baghdadi\u2019s apparent injuries.State television later also reported that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.\n\nAl-Baghdadi, an ambitious Iraqi militant believed to be in his early 40s, has a 10 million dollar US (\u00a36.2m) bounty on his head.\n\nSince taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al Qaida into an independent transnational military force, positioning himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community.\n\nMORE: ISIS now spends most of its time killing other jihadis, deserter claims\n\nA US-led coalition has been launching airstrikes on Islamic State militants and facilities in Iraq and Syria for months as part of an effort to give Iraqi forces the time and space to mount a more effective offensive.\n\nThe Islamic State had gained ground across northern and western Iraq in a lightning advance in June and July, causing several of Iraq\u2019s army and police divisions to fall into disarray.\n\nOn Friday, US President Barack Obama authorised the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, including into Anbar province, where fighting with Islamic State militants has been fierce. The plan could boost the total number of American troops in Iraq to 3,100.","Remember the crunch of the cornmeal crust? And the stringy cheese, with a slightly sweeter-than normal marinara underneath?\n\nMaybe you shoved french fries in it like birthday candles. Or ate it crust first, as was the style at the time.\n\nIn any case, if you\u2019re a child of the nineties, you remember it well: McDonald\u2019s pizza.\n\n\n\nAnd, like pogs and Beanie Babies, it too disappeared with the innocence of your childhood.\n\nExcept, in two magical locations in Ohio and West Virginia, where one hero owner has kept the McDonald\u2019s pizza ovens burning all these years later.\n\nSo bust out a gel pen to jot down these directions, because I\u2019m about to tell you where you can still buy McDonald\u2019s pizza.\n\n\nNeslted on the banks of the Ohio River, along the border with West Virginia sits the village of Pomeroy, population 1,852 in the 2010 census. And its McDonald\u2019s, located along Main Street on the riverbank, still pumps out pizza \u2014 in five minutes or less, of course.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s just a seven-and-a-half hour drive from Toronto in zero traffic, according to Google Maps.\n\nAnd, thanks to owner Greg Mills, there\u2019s another McD\u2019s where you can still get a slice, just over ninety kilometres away, across the state border. Spencer, West Virginia also boasts a McDonald\u2019s that\u2019s still lighting the pizza fires \u2014 or electrical coils, as the case may be.\n\nAccording to employee Judy Norman, it\u2019s the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and it\u2019s presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s. She said the location sold 13 pizzas yesterday, but there are \u201cdays when everyone wants pizza and there are days where just every so often you get a pizza [order].\u201d\n\nMills, who it\u2019s pretty safe to call an American hero for preserving this very unique pizza, couldn\u2019t not be immediately reached for comment, but this post will be updated should he return our calls.\n\n\n\nWhatever actually happened to McDonald\u2019s pizza, you ask?\n\nWell, for starters, it turned out adult palates didn\u2019t quite take to it the same way kids did. When McDonald\u2019s first launched its pizza in the Canadian market in the early \u201990s, it was tapping into a growing appetite for pizza as burger sales dwindled. It even launched hockey-themed TV ads.\n\n\n\nThe market for the savoury pie topped $2 billion in the early 90s, according to a 2004 National Post article on the death of McDonald\u2019s pizza. And the company poured $25 million into the ovens alone across Canada, to moderate success throughout the decade. Then the-drive through took over \u2014 remember waiting for your pizza to be delivered with a plastic number on top of your car? \u2014 and pizza slowed things down as its own sales were dragging.\n\nSo the ovens were scrapped and McDonald\u2019s turned its sights on other gimmicky productions \u2014 like the Arch Deluxe, which I think we can blame for Jessica Biel becoming a thing.","iFans can look forward to the much-awaited smartwatch from Apple making its debut this March if analysts' predictions prove true. That's not all: the 12-inch MacBook Air is also gearing up to launch in the first quarter.\n\nAccording to a research note from Ming-Chi Kuo, analyst with KGI Securities, the Apple Watch will begin shipping by March. Kuo's forecast is in keeping with recent reports that predict the same release date. He also noted that Apple may hold a special event to unveil the details of the smartwatch, whose specifications are not yet clearly known.\n\nKuo also predicted that Apple will release the new 12-inch MacBook Air in Q1 2015.\n\nThe Apple Watch is also anticipated to sell 2.8 million units in the first quarter -- that is the first month alone -- in the event that there is a March launch.\n\nAccording to Kuo, shipments in the range of 4 million to 5 million will be seen by most component suppliers in March. However, a few components may also see low production yields, which could affect the assembly and shipping.\n\nKuo also forecast that the much-rumored 12-inch MacBook Air with Retina display will also ship in the same quarter, which is in synergy with other rumors. A report earlier inJanuary suggested that Quanta Computer, an Apple supplier, was beefing up production of the notebook to meet the Q1 2015 release deadline. The ultra-thin MacBook Air is rumored to tout a fan-less design and pack in the latest low-power processor from Intel (Core M). It is also expected to boast a high resolution Retina display and may be the first to incorporate the USB Type C connector which is reversible. This may also be used for charging the device.\n\nPer Kuo, MacBook Air sales will likely touch the 6 million units sales mark (for the first three months of 2015), which is an increase from the 5.9 million forecast in Q1 2014.\n\nThe analyst sees iPhone shipments touch 61.7 million unit sales in Q1 2015. Kuo also anticipates a drop in demand for the iPad as the latest iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 tablets did not create much of a stir in the holiday season.","The man behind the world famous 50ft Crabzilla spotted lurking beneath the waters in Whitstable has described the furore caused by the colossal crustacean as \u201ca bit of fun\u201d.\n\nQuinton Winter, of Station Road, told KentOnline he was stunned by the amount of coverage the sea monster has clawed after it appeared at his exhibition at the Horsebridge Centre.\n\nAerial images of the shadowy figure emerged on the artist\u2019s bizarre blog Weird Whitstable \u2013 which documents supernatural sightings across the town.\n\nArtist Quinton Winter\nThis week it was splashed on the Daily Star front page with the story also featuring in worldwide news outlets including Australia, Malaysia and France.\n\nBut despite its popularity with the global media, the tale left online readers feeling rather crabby with criticisms it was \u201cjuvenile\u201d.\n\nQuinton said: \u201cWhen I saw the picture I thought I could use it in my exhibition.\n\n\u201cI thought it may have been a sand formation but it looked like a crab to me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to lie about anything, it\u2019s just a bit of fun.\u201d\n\nKM Group graphic artist Ashley Austen took a sceptical view of the paranormal find.\n\nCrabzilla was 'spotted' off the coast of WhitstableCrabzilla was spotted lurking beneath the water\nHe said: \u201cThe image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop.

Her motivations for doing so are based on a centuries-old legend that seventh sons will transform into werewolves.\n\nIn Argentina, the werewolf is referred to as el lobison; in Paraguay it goes by the name Luison, and in Brazil it's called the Lobisomem. The Independent elaborates on the South American legend:\n\nThe werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy\u2019s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.\n\nAs well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.\n\nIn Guaran\u00ed mythology, the lobison is the offspring of Tau, an evil spirit, and Kerana, a mortal woman. In the cultures that believe in the lobison, that creature acts as a sort of Grim Reaper, whose mere presence means that death will soon befall those it comes into contact with. As the Independent explains, by the 19th century, fear of this creature was so acute in Argentina that families sometimes murdered their seventh sons to prevent the legend from coming true. So in 1907, in an attempt to stop this practice, the Argentinean president began adopting seventh sons, which the president insisted would stop the curse. In 1973, the Independent adds, the presidential adoption tradition was also extended to seventh daughters.\n\nIn addition to being able to say he's the president's godson, Tawil will receive a gold medal and enjoy a full educational scholarship. In modern times, the curse, it seems, is more aptly described as a blessing.","al-Britani has been killed in an airstrike in Syria.","The Apple Watch is expected to be the main attraction at next week\u2019s \u201cSpring Forward\u201d event, but according to a new report, the long-rumored 12-inch Retina MacBook Air could make a surprise appearance at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.\n\nThe sketchy rumor comes from the Michael Report, which claims its sources inside Apple say the company\u2019s long-awaited update to the MacBook Air will be announced March 9.\n\n\u201cSources familiar with the matter within Apple have exclusively told The Michael Report that Apple plans to unveil the long-awaited Retina MacBook Air at the same event.

The latter includes a wide variety of funding schemes, including through medical facilities, oil and human trafficking mafias. According to sources in Mosul, the money supplied internally is allocated to local and foreign fighters, to encourage them to join up and continue fighting. IS took control of Mosul in June and then expanded in August to control large swaths of the country.\n\nResidents of Mosul say that the sale of oil extracted from wells controlled by the organization in both Iraq and Syria has provided a sustained source of funding. The organization also opened trade canals through Kurdish [territories in] Iraq and Turkey, with the help of Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian traders.\n\nIn addition to oil sales, a secondary source of funding stems from the imposition of royalties on residents in IS territories. Members of the organization collect 50,000 dinars [$41.60] from each family as service and protection fees. The amount doubles for families whose sons did not join IS. One of the prominent tribal figures in Nineveh province, Sheikh Mohammad Abu Thayyab, said, \u201cThe IS gangs imposed 50,000 dinars worth of royalties on every family if one of their sons did not join these terrorists.\u201d\n\nSources in the city say that oil prices have skyrocketed. The price of gas tanks used for cooking has reached 75,000 dinars, [about $62] while coal oil is sold at 5,000 dinars a liter [$4.16]. Meanwhile, the price of food has quadrupled.\n\nThe third funding source was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.\n\nHe said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest.\n\nThe fourth source of funding is transforming the city of Nineveh, adjacent to Turkish borders, into a new center for drug trafficking. The Russian Federal Drug Control Service said IS was gaining significant revenues by smuggling and marketing Afghan heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe.\n\n\u201cThe large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base, aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African countries,\u201d the Russian body said in a statement.\n\nFor its part, the Times of London exposed a human trafficking network established by IS in Mosul, where women and children were sold for money. This also constitutes a funding source for the fighters. According to the newspaper, women and children of Yazidi, Christian and other minority backgrounds are also sold through a networking hub in Syria\u2019s Raqqa.\n\nA report by OHCHR confirmed that more than 25,000 women and children have been imprisoned, sexually violated and sold by IS.\n\nThe sixth funding source is human smuggling rings, especially for families who wish to emigrate to other countries. One family reached Turkey after reportedly paying $8,000 for each individual that escaped.\n\nLivestock seized by IS during the occupation of Yazidi, Turkmen and Shiite villages has also been smuggled. According to Ali Abdel Razzak, the majority of the residents in these villages worked in large-scale livestock ranching. So far it has not been established how much IS members seized as spoils of war when the villagers fled.\n\nWhen it comes to foreign funding, the organization has developed schemes that are difficult to uncover, despite intensive local and international monitoring. One such method, however, uses established trading routes. The organization has networks tasked with collecting donations from wealthy individuals under the pretext of supporting jihad. According to some sources in the trading industry, products are sold in the markets in IS at lower prices than within the countries of origin, a discrepancy that points toward money laundering.","A woman in China chopped off her husband's penis not once, but twice.\n\nAfter Feng Lung, 30, found out that Fan Lung, 32, was sending racy emails to another woman, she chopped it off, according to the Mirror.\n\nLung had used Feng's cell phone to send his lover an email, according to the news outlet.\n\nAfter forgetting to log out of his account, she found the messages, and stormed into the bedroom where her husband was sleeping and allegedly cut off his penis with a pair of scissors.\n\nBut the anger for her husband and the father of her five children didn't stop there.\n\nWhile he was recovering in the hospital, she allegedly snipped it off again after surgeons had reattached it.\n\nShe then threw it out the window.\n\nDespite losing a lot of blood, Lung chased his wife outside.\n\n\"Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman,\" a hospital spokesperson said according to the news outlet.\n\nDoctors and police officers failed to find his penis when they searched outside.\n\nFeng Lung is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm, the new outlet reports.\n\nBut Fan Lung's lover isn't alarmed that Lung is missing his penis.\n\n\"It doesn't matter that he's lost his fertility, he has five children already,\" she said.","The 45-year-old was investigating the devastating terrorist attack at Charlie Hebdo magazine when he killed himself\n\nVIEW GALLERY\n\nA senior French police officer investigating the Charlie Hebdo magazine massacre killed himself just hours after the horrific terror attack.\n\nCommissioner Helric Fredou, 45, shot himself in his police office in Limoges last Wednesday night, France 3 reported.\n\nHis body was found by a colleague at 1am on Thursday, hours after the terror attack at the satirical magazine's office which left 12 people dead.\n\nIt has been reported that shortly before committing suicide Commissioner Fredou had met with the family of one of the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack massacre.\n\nSpeaking to Mirror Online, the Union of Commissioners of the National Police confirmed Mr Fredou had committed suicide.\n\nIn a statement released after his death, a spokesman for the union said: \"It is with great sadness that we were informed this morning of the death of our colleague Helric Fredou, assigned as Deputy Director of the Regional Service Judicial Police in Limoges.\n\nGetty   Firefighters carry a victim on a stretcher at the scene of the Charlie Hebdo shooting\n\n\"On this particular day of national mourning, police commissioners are hit hard by the tragic death of one of their own.\n\n\"The Union of Commissioners of the National Police would like to present its most sincere condolences to the relatives of Helric.\n\n\"In these difficult times, we have a special thought for all his colleagues.\"\n\nMr Fredou - who was single and had no children - began his career as a police officer in 1997, working in Versailles.\n\nHe eventually returned to his home town of Limoges and in 2012 became deputy director of the regional police service.\n\nFrench media reports suggest he was depressed and was suffering from burnout.\n\nBrothers Said and Cherif Kouachi launched last Wednesday's devastating attack at the office's of the French satirical magazine.\n\nThe attack left 12 people dead.

The move was intended to ensure that one of the most popular games was available for the computing giant\u2019s family of devices.\n\nThe sides still need to work out many details, and a deal could fall through, according to one of these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nAcquiring Minecraft would give Microsoft control of an online world that has defied many of the conventions of the modern games business to become a blockbuster success.\n\nMinecraft\u2019s blocky graphics are crude by today\u2019s standards, looking like virtual Lego bricks. But unlike many of the start-ups purchased by big technology companies for billions of dollars, Minecraft is already a lucrative business. This year, Mojang, the privately held Swedish company that makes Minecraft, told The Wall Street Journal that its revenue was about $360 million last year, up 38 percent from the year before. The Journal reported the discussions with Microsoft earlier on Tuesday. Mojang was co-founded by Markus Persson, a 35-year-old programmer and game designer who is better known in the gaming world by his gamer name, Notch. Mr. Persson has said in the past that he did not want to sell the company or take money from outside investors.\nIn an era when many games, especially for mobile devices, are given away, and derive their profit from the sale of virtual currency and other items, Mojang sells Minecraft the old-fashioned way \u2014 by charging people to buy a copy. The price varies depending on what kind of device people use to play the game, ranging from $7 on mobile phones to $27 for computer versions. A version of Minecraft for Microsoft\u2019s Xbox, which has been a top seller for the console, costs $20.\n\nFor Microsoft, the interest in a deal is motivated in large part by a desire to ensure that attractive content is available for some of its most important platforms. Minecraft is not currently available on Windows Phone, the mobile operating system that Microsoft has struggled to turn into a strong competitor to Apple\u2019s iPhone and Google\u2019s Android.\n\nMinecraft has also not been adapted to take advantage of the graphical interface of Microsoft\u2019s latest operating system for computers and tablets, Windows 8. The game is not available for purchase in the Windows Store, Microsoft\u2019s online app store.\n\nGaming remains one of the most popular applications for mobile devices and computers. The lack of timely versions of top titles for its devices has been a problem for Microsoft as it tries to compete more aggressively with rivals like Apple, Samsung and Google.\nBy the standards of Microsoft, which had nearly $86 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of June, a $2 billion-plus deal would be relatively small. Because Mojang is a European company, Microsoft would be able to use cash from overseas operations to fund the deal, a more attractive prospect than bringing the cash back to the United States where it would be subject to hefty repatriation taxes.\n\nA spokeswoman for Microsoft declined to comment. Mr. Persson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMicrosoft first approached Mojang about three months ago, interested in pursuing a deal, one of the people briefed on the discussions said. By that point, the company \u2014 and Mr. Persson in particular \u2014 had considered a sale, having received takeover approaches worth about $1 billion in the last few years.\n\nSoon after, Microsoft made an initial offer, prompting more serious talks between the sides. Last month, Mojang hired additional advisers to assist in the discussions.\n\nTalks are continuing between them, and an agreement could be reached by the end of the month, the person briefed on the discussions said.\n\nWhile Mr. Persson is said to accept that he may not stay for more than six months if a deal is struck, Mojang is pressing to try to ensure that Microsoft retains its younger developers.\n\nIn a Q. and A. hosted on the Internet forum Reddit a year ago, Mr. Persson described growing up relatively poor. After he created the popular game, he wrote, he has earned a huge amount of money that he spends on computers, gaming consoles and traveling. \u201cI might eventually get a driver\u2019s license so I can buy a car,\u201d he added.","SEOUL, Feb. 5 (Korea Bizwire) \u2013 A powerful robot vacuum cleaner caused an unlikely accident involving a Korean housewife, and required the intervention of a couple of paramedics. On January 3, a woman in her fifties had her hair sucked up into a robot vacuum at her home in the city of Changwon, South Korea.\n\nOn the day of the accident, she turned on her robot vacuum as usual, and laid down flat on the floor to rest, leaving the robot to do its job. The robot vacuum came around her relaxing on the floor, and suddenly sucked her hair into its nozzle. The vacuum stopped running one to two minutes after the sudden hair intake.\n\nThe startled housewife called 119, Korea\u2019s emergency telephone number. Fortunately, paramedics quickly arrived at the scene, and successfully disjoined her hair from the nozzle. The housewife suffered only minor injuries.\n\nThe problematic robot vacuum had a nozzle with a roller inside, which sweeps and vacuums floors. The Changwon Fire Service Headquarters presumed that the vacuum\u2019s sensors identified the woman\u2019s hair as dust.\n\nThe likelihood of this type accident occurring is undoubtedly more significant in countries with a \u201csitting-on-the-floor\u201d culture. Since Koreans love to rest or relax on a toasty, cleanly swept floor, exercising caution on using a robot vacuum is probably a good idea.","If you're an American and you've been watching the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong closely, you may have noticed something familiar: a number of the young demonstrators are using the same \"hands up, don't shoot\" gesture that became a symbol of last month's protests in faraway Ferguson, Missouri.\n\n\nHong Kong's protesters have good reason to put their hands up: police are using what many observers describe as an unprecedented level of force against the demonstrations, which are rallying against the Chinese government for reneging on its promise to grant them full democracy in 2017. While injuries in the protests have been relatively few so far, the clashes have been bad enough that Hong Kongers appear to earnestly fear the police might crack down violently, and that anxiety is showing in these photos.\n\n\nIt's impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to Ferguson, or borrowing something they'd seen on the news for their own purposes, or using it coincidentally. But Hong Kongers, particularly young Hong Kongers, pride themselves on being plugged in to the world, so it is well within the realm of possibility that they followed the events in Ferguson and are now appropriating the gesture for their own use. Some of the protesters are organized within a group called Occupy Central, named for Hong Kong's Central financial district and for the global protest movement that began with Occupy Wall Street.\n\n\nIt's fascinating to see a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America become a symbol of democracy and freedom halfway around the world, however it got there.","\u201cThe aerial shot enables viewers to see the full body of the crab, including its pinchers and legs,\u201d says the AOL article.\nThe article also mentions a man who runs a website devoted to the weird and unusual.

Due to his no-show at his friend\u2019s party, the young child was actually given an invoice and billed for his nonappearance.\n\nAccording to the Plymouth Herald, Derek Nash says that his son Alex was given a \u201cchild\u2019s party no show fee\u201d invoice for not going to a friend\u2019s birthday party. The bill for \u00a315.95 (approx. $25) was in his son\u2019s school bag last week and Nash \u201cthought it was a joke.\u201d\n\nThe party was scheduled for before the Christmas holidays when Alex was invited to one of his Torpoint Nursery and Infant School classmate\u2019s birthday party. It was being held at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre, and the Nash family indicated that Alex would be attending the party.\n\n\u201cShe saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nAs the Metro stated, Nash informed the classmate\u2019s mother in person that his son would be going to the party. It was after that conversation that Nash realized the family already had a family trip planned for that day.\n\nUpon trying to cancel Alex\u2019s acceptance to the party, Nash found no way to contact the party-thrower.\n\n\u201cWe did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy\u2019s mother] know. So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do \u2013 he chose to be with his grandparents.\u201d\n\nIt was a week later that the invoice for Alex\u2019s no-show was received. A teacher at the Torpoint Nursery and Infant School is actually the one who put the notice in the boy\u2019s school bag, and the school has since issued an apology for their involvement in the matter.\n\nAlex\u2019s teacher said that she would let all staff know that giving the boy an invoice was a \u201cbreach of protocol.\u201d\n\nDerek Nash said he then left the school and went to visit the birthday boy\u2019s mother since her address was now on the invoice. He let her know that he \u201cwould not be paying her the money\u201d and that \u201cshe should have spoken to me first.\u201d\n\nThe birthday boy\u2019s mother has since threatened the Nash family with legal action and could possibly take them to small claims court to get the money she is owed.\n\nAs for Alex Nash and his classmate at the Torpoint Nursery?

While initial news reports seemed to suggest her death was an accident, her note made her intentions clear:\n\nIf you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be sad, it\u2019s for the better. The life I would\u2019ve lived isn\u2019t worth living in\u2026 because I\u2019m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy\u2019s body, and I\u2019ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally \u201cboyish\u201d things to try to fit in.\n\nWhen I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn\u2019t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don\u2019t tell this to your kids.\n\nEven if you are Christian or are against transgender people don\u2019t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won\u2019t do anything but make them hate them self. That\u2019s exactly what it did to me.\n\nMy mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more Christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.\n\nWhen I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life.\n\nOn my 16th birthday, when I didn\u2019t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.\n\nRelated: 12-Year-Old Boy Commits Suicide After Anti-Gay Bullying For Being A Cheerleader\n\nLater, she detailed her emotional turmoil.\n\nAfter a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I\u2019ve had enough. I\u2019m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I\u2019m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I\u2019m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I\u2019m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I\u2019m never going to find a man who loves me. I\u2019m never going to be happy.\n\nEither I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There\u2019s no winning.

shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.\n\u201cThe Iraqi Parliament\u2019s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,\u201d Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.\nHe said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.\n\nThe senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.\n\nThe Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.\n\nEarlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.\n\naqaba israel_012\n\n\u201cWe have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL\u2019s control in Al-Baqdadi region,\u201d the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.\n\nHe noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.\n\nAl-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition\u2019s planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.\n\nAl-Zameli underlined that  the coalition is the main cause of ISIL\u2019s survival in Iraq.\n\n\u201cThere are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition\u2019s military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),\u201d he told FNA in January.\n\nHe noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.\n\n\u201cThe US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.\n\nHe noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, \u201cThese documents are given to the investigation committee \u2026 and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.\u201d\n\nAlso in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL\u2019s survival in Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,\u201d Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.\n\nHe said the coalition\u2019s support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, \u201cThe coalition has not targeted ISIL\u2019s main positions in Iraq.\u201d\n\nIn late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.\n\nMP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.\n\nHe added that the US and the international coalition are \u201cnot serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month\u201d.\n\nGharawi added that \u201cthe US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.\u201d\n\nSalahuddin security commission also disclosed that \u201cunknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city\u201d.\n\nAlso in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.\n\n\u201cThe international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,\u201d Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.\n\n\u201cThe ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,\u201d she added.\n\nHababi said that the coalition\u2019s precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.\n\nIn late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.\n\nField sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.\n\nIn October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.\n\n\u201cThe US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group \u2013 while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition\u2019s and the US\u2019 claims,\u201d Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.\nThe US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.\n\nThe US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.\n\nVideo footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.\n\nThe Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL\u2019s deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue.","Editor's Note: This story appeared in Saturday's edition of the Daily Mail.\nJihadi John, the Briton who beheaded two British and two American hostages held by Islamic State terrorists, has been injured in a US-led air strike, according to reports received by the Foreign Office.\nThe masked \u2018executioner\u2019 with a London accent is believed to have narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit of the group\u2019s leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday.\nThe meeting was targeted by American and Iraqi jets.\nRead the full story here.","FARAH, Afghanistan \u2013 An Afghan mother avenged the death of her son \u2013 a police officer \u2013 at the hands of the Taliban, by killing at least 25 Taliban insurgents and injuring several others in Farah Province, media reported November 24.\n\nRelated Articles\nNangarhar, Farah clashes kill 20 Taliban\nTaliban kill kidnapped provincial council candidate, 9 others\nKunduz, Farah clashes kill 9 Taliban, 4 policemen\nThe woman, identified as Reza Gul, picked up a weapon and started shooting at Taliban militants after she saw them kill her son at a police check-point, Khaama Press reported.

As phones get bigger, it becomes impossible to do even the simplest tasks without both hands.\n\nThe new phone is rumored to be replacing the iPhone 5c model. The 5c has been Apple\u2019s budget model since its release in September 2013.\n\nThe 5c lacked many of the features of the 5s model, such as using the Apple 5 model\u2019s A6 chip instead of the A7 that came with the 5s, not having Touch ID, lacking the M7 motion co-processor and other minor features. The iPhone 5c was discontinued in September 2014 when the iPhone 6 was announced.\n\nAccording to Pocketnow, this rumor might signify that Apple wants to standardize their current iPhone models with a small (4-inch), mid-sized (4.7-inch) and phablet (5.5-inch) display. Whether the new 4-inch iPhone would be marketed as a budget iPhone is impossible to say at this point.\n\nApple stayed with a 3.5-inch display for five generations as its rivals grew progressively larger. Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, said in 2010 that the smaller screen was better because it was easier to \u201cget your hands around it.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared at Digital Journal.

The Washington Post\u2019s report on the butchery includes this nugget that should have Americans thinking twice, too:\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the apparent executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine.\n\nHundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country\u2019s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cMany of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.\u201d\n\nA European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it with former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.\n\nBoth prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online.\nThe May 2004 Berg killing was conducted by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Tawhid wal-Jihad at the beginning of the 2003 Iraq war, which became al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) at around the time of that beheading. US forces killed Zarqawi in an American airstrike, but AQI survived his death and the Anbar Awakening (if barely) to morph into ISIS when the US pulled out of Iraq. Berg was not the only American beheaded by Zarqawi, either; he also killed Owen Eugene Armstrong later in the same year, and both Berg and Armstrong wore orange jumpsuits when murdered, as did James Foley.\n\nThe orange jumpsuits are obviously referencing Guantanamo Bay, but the British seem concerned that there\u2019s more than just symbolism now in play with ISIS. The US began releasing British subjects from Gitmo during the Bush administration under international pressure to shut down the facility, as well as releasing other detainees to their home countries, all of whom pledged to ensure that they would not return to the fight. We\u2019ve seen plenty of recidivism since then, and all to this same end \u2014 to rejoin the jihad against the West and the nations in this region, and to recruit others to do the same.\n\nIt won\u2019t be a surprise if the jihadist turns out to be a former Gitmo detainee, but it is a bit of a surprise that the UK doesn\u2019t keep a close enough watch on those former detainees to account for their whereabouts immediately. After all, they have already been identified as threats, picked up in the battle zones far from home, which is how they ended up in Gitmo in the first place. The bigger worry for the UK \u2014 and for the US and other Western nations \u2014 will be how many of these butchers will make it back home undetected and anonymous. It should also have us taking great care not to release those who still present a danger, especially since we\u2019re now desperately looking for ways to roll back ISIS. Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t provide them more fighters than they already have.","Uh oh.

Of the two, differences are slight, but the camera hardware Apple went with on the iPhone 6 Plus is a good reason to stop and consider which you really want. A new rumor suggests those still standing in front of tables at the Apple Store might want to walk away for a few months, as the iPhone 6S camera might end up being even better than the iPhone 6 Plus\u2019.\n\nAccording to Money.UDN, the iPhone 6S will have a dual-lens camera. We\u2019ve heard similar rumblings before, as Sony announced new camera hardware for mobile devices with a \u201cdual lens\u201d.

According to Money, the iPhone 6S will have an optical zoom feature, which is something smartphones generally slouch on. Rather than rely on digital enhancements, a hardware fix for zoom may be inbound.\n\nAs if a cool new camera wasn\u2019t enough, the report also cites supply chain sources on pressure sensors which Apple is said to include on the next iPhone. One sensor will track blood pressure and heart rate, which makes sense for Apple\u2019s HealthKit, but ultimately seems to clumsy for an iPhone.\n\niphone-6-nfc-820x420-600x307\n\nThe second sensor is even more hard to understand. Supply chain sources say that one will be made available for use with a 3D interface. We\u2019ve seen job openings for Apple\u2019s VR initiatives (which are kind of 3D), but it\u2019s early on for anything 3D for an iPhone, and it\u2019s an unlikely aesthetic change for Apple\u2019s iOS. In the wake of iOS 7\u2019s visual update, there\u2019s no way Apple would go full 3D.\n\nFinally, the report suggests Apple is ditching the 16GB iPhone base model for a 32GB version. If that\u2019s true, good on them; it\u2019s overdue.\n\nMuch of these rumors seem like foie gras; force-fed from patent filings and other news tidbits. A new camera is likely, and we\u2019re sure Apple is at least entertaining the idea of dropping the underwhelming 16GB model.

It points out:\n\n'...The JASMINETRIDEVIL.COM domain was registered by someone named Alisha Hessler, and Jasmine Tridevil herself bears a striking likeness to Tampa-area massage therapist Alisha Jasmine Hessler (whose \"Alisha's Golden Touch\" massage web site now bears legends identifying her as \"Provider of internet hoaxes since 2014\" and \"Specialist in massage for three breasted women\"). Photos on a modeling page linked with Hessler closely matched the circulating images of Jasmine Tridevil, and profile pictures on Hessler's YouTube page strongly resembled the woman in the \"third breast\" photos.'\n\nSnopes also claims an Alisha Jasmine Hessler was taken into custody in Florida last year and charged with fraudulent use of personal information and that a woman with the same name has had previous brushes with viral fame.\n\nHowever Tridevil continues to insist she and her three breasts are the real deal.\n\nShe told The Sun (\u00a3): \u201cThis is not a fake.

As I say this is not a fake or a hoax.\u201d\n\nSpeaking exclusively to 10 News Tampa, Tridevil obliged the channel with a \"quick flash\" of her third breast, but when asked why she wouldn't allow a closer look, replied with: \"I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.\"\n\nMeanwhile Jezebel spoke to an attending plastic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles.\n\nLooks familiar: A three-breasted woman makes an appearance in 1990's Total Recall\n\nKaitlyn Leeb reprised the role in the 2012 remake of the film\n\nDr Mossi Salibian, a member of the hospital\u2019s multidisciplinary breast expert team, said such a procedure would be possible, but mercifully added he didn\u2019t believe any doctor would perform such an operation.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are many things that are possible, but that doesn\u2019t mean we would do it.\u201d\n\nOver to you, dear readers.","The despot is putting on the pounds with the Swiss cheese, according to reports, possible because being fat is considered good in North Korea.\n\nIs a dangerous cheese addiction making Kim Jong-un seriously ill?\n\nNorth Korea's demented despot dictator is reportedly ballooning in weight after getting hooked on Emmental, a cheese produced in Switzerland.\n\nThe 31-year-old is said to be importing huge quantities of the savory Swiss treat \u2014 which he first discovered while studying in the European country as a child.\n\nRumors surrounding his dairy dependence surfaced after he appeared on TV with a swollen face.\n\nHe also had a limp during the Pyongyang ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the death of the nation\u2019s founder Kim Il-sung.\n\nDissidents who have fled the Hermit Kingdom, where millions of citizens are reportedly starving to death, said his increasing weight was affecting his health.\n\nAnd they claimed he was bulking himself up in a bid to look like his grandfather.\n\n\"North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny,\" defector Cho Myung-Chul, of the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, told the Mirror.\n\n\"There is a high chance Jong-un intentionally gained weight to look like Il-sung,\" he added.","Raven-Symon\u00e9 took to Instagram to deny rumors that Bill Cosby molested her while she was on The Cosby Show.\n\nThe rumor has been gaining steam for a few days now ever since a site called Hip Hop Hangover published a story claiming the actress was drugged and raped by Cosby and had filed charges against him.

[MTV]\nHere is a video of TayTay's cat Meredith Grey Swift playing fetch:","After news broke yesterday that Jasmine Tridevil, 21, of Tampa had allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third boob implanted on her chest to make herself \"unattractive to men,\" we've heard whispers in the wind (and read stories) that this Third Boob is a stunt, a hoax. It very well might be. http://gawker.com/woman-gets-thi...\n\nProfessional debunkers Snopes has classified Tridevil's third boob story as \"FALSE,\" largely because almost all of the alleged evidence (photo, video) is coming directly from Tridevil herself: No family members or friends have confirmed the surgery first-hand. And Tridevil claims the doctor who performed the surgery forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, conveniently making his or her testimony unattainable. They point out that in this YouTube video posted to her page, Tridevil's alleged third boob is a different skin tone then the rest of her body.\n\nTrivdevil granted an exclusive interview with WTSP last night, where she briefly flashed all three of her breasts. When the reporter asked for another, longer look, Tridevil declined, telling the reporter, \"I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.\"\n\nYes, Tridevil purports to be self-producing a reality series she hopes will be picked up by a television network. Fitting, because according to the snoops at Snopes, this apparently isn't the first time Tridevil has tried to turn herself into a star. Well, a woman claiming to be Jasmine Tridevil, at least: jasminetridevil.com, which has since expired, was registered to a Alisha Hessler, one who bears a striking resemblance to a Tampa massage therapist that has had brushes with viral fame before.\n\nLast year, Hessler allegedly made the man who beat her wear a dunce cap and hold a sign reading \"I BEAT WOMEN, HONK IF I'M A SCUMBAG\" in a busy intersection. Police made multiple attempts to follow up with Hessler about the incident, but she apparently refused all the calls.\n\nAnd in March of 2013, Snopes reports, Hessler was booked in Tampa on a fraudulent use of personal information charge.\n\nDoctors have confirmed that no surgeon in their right mind would allow this surgery to ever happen, namely because Tridevil/Hessler's case raises mental health red flags. Nilesh Sojitra of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons told BuzzFeed:\n\nThis is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery \u2013 she will now be scarred for life \u2013 and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery. Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would.\n\nAnd Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery told WTSP, \"I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person.\"\n\nSo it would appear unlikely that the Third Boob is real. That is the \"truth.\" But the truth is, we all have a third boob\u2014our hearts. It beats when you believe in yourself. It beats when you chase your dreams. So while this Third Boob might just be a Halloween costume prosthetic used to hop on the easily started viral joy ride, the Third Boob in all of us beats on.\n\n[Image via WTSP]","British jihadist al-Britani was reportedly killed in a US air strike on Syria.","IS it Crabzilla or Claws?

These tinfoil hatters took their inspiration from two anonymously sourced paragraphs buried in an early Washington Post report on Foley's murder from Tuesday:\n\nTranslation: Flummoxed U.K. intel officials were checking the murder against the usual suspects, hoping to stumble onto a clue in the tiny pool of data they already had before reluctantly wading into the murkier waters of global jihadism. That's standard sleuthing.\n\nAnd it's sadly unsurprising that the Islamic State's propagandists dressed Foley up in an oversized t-shirt mimicking the infamous orange jumpsuits put on problem detainees at Gitmo; Al Qaeda in Iraq had similarly garbed several of its condemned captives in outfits imitating the jumpsuits\u2014enduring symbols of the mistreatments, real and supposed, of Gitmo inmates.\n\nBut to Islamophobic, Gitmo-loving conservatives, these paragraphs could mean so much more:\n\nPresumably, Tsotsoros meant the Bush administration, since it's the one that released all of the 10 British citizens that have been repatriated from Guantanamo, all between 2004 and 2007. And York's choice of ellipses is deceptive, since it implies that the Post was referring to some of those ex-detainees as Syria-based jihadists, when it also was referencing a larger pool of some 800 to 1,500 other British citizens that have traveled to fight for ISIS. (None of the U.K.'s ex-Gitmo inmates is believed to have gone to Syria except Moazzam Begg, who has been in British custody since February on charges related to his travels.)\n\nBut never let facts get in the way of a good psychotic B.S. meme. By Wednesday morning, Hot Air's Ed Morrisey was just asking questions, and the game of right-wing telephone was on:\n\nBy Wednesday night, the Gitmo link had become \"likely\" on conservative Twitter:\n\nThe rumors, like hot sludge on a city street, had trickled down to the lowest internet gutter:\n\nAnd the rumors mutated into straight-up, demonstrably false partisan bullshit:\n\nAnd hey, where did the Islamofascists get that orange jumpsuit anyway? Isn't that federal government property? You can't just buy that stuff, right?\n\nLet me reiterate: Whatever hype you may hear, no U.K. Guantanamo detainee released by this administration is responsible for this reprehensible murder, because this administration hasn't released any U.K. detainees from Guantanamo.\n\nIs it remotely possible that one of the 10 Gitmo detainees with British citizenship released by the Bush administration has slipped off into Syria and become an executioner? I don't know the whereabouts of all of them, so I can't say no for sure. But it's astronomically less likely than the possibility that \"Jihadi John,\" as the Brits are calling Foley's presumed killer, is any one of several hundred other disaffected Syria-based zealots with U.K. passports\u2014like, say, this doctor's brother, or any of these idiots, all of them younger than the Gitmo releasees.\n\nAbout the only thing that's certain is that conservatives\u2014who cleave to simplistic, manichaean narratives like ornery toddlers to security blankets\u2014must have a villain, even if they have to create it.\n\n[Photo credit: Twitter]","Justin Bieber at amfAR's 21st Cinema Against AIDS Gala.

Rivers reportedly did not consent to the biopsy.\n\nThen it was revealed the clinic doctor who performed Rivers\u2019s endoscopy, gastroenterologist Lawrence Cohen, no longer works for Yorkville. There have been conflicting reports about whether he resigned or was fired. A spokesman for the clinic told The Wrap: \u201cDr. Cohen is not currently performing procedures at Yorkville Endoscopy, nor is he currently serving as medical director.\u201d\n\nAnd now, an unnamed source claims Rivers\u2019s personal doctor took a selfie while she was under general anesthesia, according to a report by CNN. Rivers\u2019s doctor remains unnamed, and the alleged selfie has not yet surfaced in news reports.\n\nRivers entered Yorkville Endoscopy in New York City on Aug. 28 for a procedure to determine why she was hoarse and her throat was sore. She stopped breathing when her vocal cords began to swell during the biopsy and went into cardiac arrest. Rivers was put in a medically induced coma and died at Mount Sinai hospital on Sept. 4 at age 81. Initial autopsy results from the New York Medical Examiner\u2019s Office were deemed inconclusive.","Apple is planning to discontinue Beats Music, the streaming music service that it acquired as part of an acquisition of Beats Electronics back in May. According to TechCrunch, multiple sources that include \"several prominent employees at Apple and Beats\" have confirmed that Apple is shutting down the music service.Many engineers from Beats Music have already been moved off the product and onto other projects at Apple, including iTunes. It's not clear when exactly Jimmy Iovine and Dr Dre's music service will be shut down or what Apple will do with streaming, but every source with knowledge of the situation that we talked to agreed Apple plans to sunset the Beats Music brand.Apple first acquired Beats Music in May, and at the time, announced plans to leave the music service untouched. There were no plans to integrate Beats Music into iTunes, with the company suggesting that it would remain as a standalone service.\n\nApple shutting down Beats Music is unusual news given the efforts that the company has gone to in order to promote it in recent weeks, adding it to the list of \"Apps Made by Apple\" and recommending the app to new iOS users.","Production is \"gearing up\" for the upcoming launch of the Apple Watch, according to a fresh report from Digitimes.\n\nIndustry sources indicate that as many as 40 million units of Apple's custom chip have been ordered to prepare for initial shipments. These numbers suggest that the Cupertino tech giant is expecting high global demand for its innovative smartwatch.\n\n\nAlong with those high production stats, however, come potentially high prices for consumers. When the Apple Watch was first revealed in September, the base model was announced at a $350 for an aluminum band. This is well over $100 more than similar products from competitors like Sony and Motorola. The ever-looming Apple tax doesn't stop there either.\n\nApple Watch stainless steel bands could start as high as $500, says French Apple blog iGen.fr, while wealthy buyers hoping to purchase a solid gold band for their Apple smartwatch may have to shell out as much as $5,000. French pricing schemes may vary widely from what we see on day one in the United States, so the accuracy of these figures is still up for debate. Fans of Apple products are used to paying higher prices for premium goods, and that trend seems to be alive and well in the company's latest product.\n\nFor those wondering when the Apple Watch hits store shelves, a recent rumor report from Business Insider pegs a release as soon as Valentine's Day 2015. That date is supposedly an optimistic one, however, so officials at Apple are more inclined to stick to a tentative spring 2015 time frame.\n\nAs production enters its heaviest phases, Apple seems ready to tackle the watch industry in full force.

It is normally quite easy to check a circulating story by searching online","Claim: Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil underwent surgery to add a third breast.\n\nUNDETERMINED\n\nExample: [Collected via e-mail, September 2014]\n\n\"A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.\"\n\nWell, this has 'What does Snopes say?' written all over it!\n\nOrigins: On 22 September 2014, a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web. According to several circulating articles, a Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a \"third breast\" to her body.\n\nIn the initial frenzy of interest in Jasmine Tridevil and her purported third breast, lots of linking and re-posting of the same information and images occurred. However, few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents, or whether such a modification was even feasible.\n\nA New York article about the woman's third breast reveals a potentially relevant aspect of Tridevil's claim. According to the site, the Florida woman claims her surgeon forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim is closed off:\n\nThe 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.\n\nAs Jasmine Tridevil's claims about a third breast circulate the social web, most information being reported appears to come directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation. Tridevil's Facebook page and YouTube account appear to be the primary source for verification, despite the fact that both host only self-taken videos and photos. In one clip posted by Tridevil, her \"breasts\" appear to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs:\n\nAnother red flag in Tridevil's tale is her stated motivations. Surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances (i.e., ensuring that patients do not have unrealistic expectations or motivations driven by psychological disorders), and in an interview Tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant:\n\nI got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore ... Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know ... feel pretty.\n\nJasmine Tridevil's third breast tale has a few other potential inconsistencies.

Not only has the Korean technological giant outfitted Apple's premium iPad tablets with their high-resolution displays, but the latest word on the subject is that the relationship will continue for the Apple Watch as well! JP Morgan analyst JJ Park claims that LG is the sole supplier of the wearable's flexible Plastic OLED screen.\n\nLG has been on the forefront of this technology, going as far as to produce flexible lighting panels made entirely of plastic. So Apple's demands shouldn't be a problem for LG's display arm, although it has quite a bit of work cut out for it with Cupertino gearing up to ship 26 to 29 million watches this year, and another 61 million next. This will generate billions of dollars (and trillions of Korean wons) of revenue for LG, but other analysts think Apple will ship just 8.5 million watches, so let's not juggle the big numbers already.\n\nLG aside, Apple's dream team of component suppliers for the iWatch includes Quanta (EMS), Samsung (application processors), ASE (system-in-package modules), Amkor and STATS ChipPAC.

Uric acid is a waste product that forms when the body breaks down chemicals in the cells known as purines.\n\nIf you produce too much uric acid or excrete too little when you urinate, the uric acid will build up and may cause needle-like crystals in and around the joints, most commonly in the foot (particularly the big toe), but also the knees, fingers, forearms and elbows.\n\nThe crystals may spill over from the joint cartilage into the joint space, causing a painful attack.\n\nFoods naturally high in purines include red meat \u2013 such as beef, lamb and pork - seafood, especially shellfish and oily fish, and offal.\n\n'It is protein-rich foods that cause gout,' dietitian Helen Bond told MailOnline. 'Cheese is not a high risk food, although eating a lot of it will mean he is likely to have high calcium \u2013 and cholesterol \u2013 levels.'\n\nOther risk factors include obesity - partly because of extra pressure on the joints and chemical changes as a result of the fat - and heavy alcohol consumption, particularly beer, which is high in purines, and spirits.\n\nSmoking is not generally seen as a risk factor for gout.\n\nThe 31-year-old North Korean leader got a taste for Swiss cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities, despite Western sanctions.\n\nA unhealthy appetite for Emmental, also known as Swiss cheese, is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning so much in recent months that he now walks with a limp.\n\nExperts believe Kim may be deliberately gaining weight in order to look more like his grandfather Kim Il-sung, who is venerated in North Korea as the nation's founder and even now - exactly 20 years after his death - is still considered the head of state, with the title Eternal President of the Republic.\n\nKim has not been a presence in state media since attending a Pyongyang concert on September 3.\n\nThere's been no discussion of the absence in the authoritarian North's media.\n\nNorth Korea's official Korean Central Television says the Supreme People's Assembly approved the promotion of Hwang Pyong So as the vice chairman of the country's powerful National Defense Commission.\n\nKim Jong-un's unhealthy obsession with Emmental has led to him importing vast quantities of the cheese for his own consumption - despite millions of North Koreans struggling to find enough to eat.\n\nMalnutrition is widespread and famines often break out in the country, which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s.\n\nBut despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens, Kim continues to gorge on Swiss cheese in such vast quantities that he is waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate, according to the Mirror.\n\nNorth Koreans who have managed to flee the country believe the weight gain may be deliberate in order to look more like his corpulent late grandfather Kim Il-sung.\n\nHe established an all-pervasive cult of personality around himself after turning North Korea into a oppressive single-party socialist state in the early 1980s.\n\nDefector Cho Myung-Chul, of the Saenuri Party, said: 'North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny.\n\n'There is a high chance Jong-un intentionally gained weight to look like Il-sung.'","Jim Suva with Citigroup this evening weighs in with what to expect from the March 9th media event in San Francisco that Apple (AAPL) announced today, an event that is likely focused on Apple Watch, given that, as he points out, Daylight Savings Time starts the day before, March 8th, so the tag line of the event, \u201cSpring Forward,\u201d is an apt time reference.\n\nSuva, who has a Buy rating on Apple, and a $135 price target, lays out the prospects for details about the watch, including pricing:\n\nWe expect Apple to give specifics on the launch time, price, and geographic locations, which we estimate as: Launch date: April 16th; Price points: $350, $550 and $950; with a launch limited to the U.S., followed by Europe and Asia in the subsequent months.

In addition to Kuo\u2019s research note, however, other reports also have said the watch will be generally available in March.\n\nBefore the device becomes available, Apple will reveal additional information on the watch, including battery specifics and pre-order details, said Kuo, according to a story on the website MacRumors. Apple has said the smartwatch will need nightly recharging, but hasn\u2019t offered other battery information.\n\nComponent issues may cause supply problems for the watch, Kuo said. Even with possible component shortages, Apple will sell 2.8 million Apple Watches in March and go on to sell 5 million devices in the first quarter of 2015, he said. Kuo called for iPhone shipments for that quarter to exceed 61 million units and iPad shipments to come in at 10 million units.\n\nApple will also launch a 12-inch MacBook Air that quarter, said Kuo.

All 17 crew members of the Guinean Luck are reported to have died from the ebola hemorrhagic fever and the presence of thousands of rats possibly infected with the disease aboard the ship could represent a major threat for the American population.\n\nThe ship left Sierra Leone on July 13 2014 in destination of the Mexican city of Tampico. Six days after leaving the port of Freetown, the captain of the ship reported in a radio communication that three of the crew members were beginning to show distressing symptoms that suggested they could be infected with ebola, and that the ship was changing course to head towards Cape Verde to get some medical help. This was the last time that the crew was heard of, and all 17 men on board are presumed to have died in only a few days later.\n\n\"We are determined to protect the American population from this unique threat\" says coast guard commander, James Fitzgerald. \"There is no way we are going to let those disease-ridden rats set foot in the USA. We're gonna find that ship and we're gonna sink it!\"\n\nThe fictitious World News Daily Report article contained fabricated photos, made-up mathematical measurements, and imaginary quotes from invented officials. These dubious details gave the story an air of authenticity, and many readers took to social media to spread news of the ghost ship's impending arrival.\n\nBut there is no truth to the above-quoted story.

The dual lens setup will help the iPhone capture more light, resulting in better photos. It will also add optical zoom capability to the camera, which also gives better photos compared to cameras with digital zoom.\n\nThe report also says that Apple will use its Force Touch technology in the upcoming iPhones. This technology, already being used in Apple Watch, will allow the touchscreen distinguish between light taps and long presses, thus allowing the users to interact with their iPhones in several new ways. Moreover, the touch sensors said to be used in the new iPhones can determine the users' blood pressure and pulse more accurately.","Jasmine Tridevil, 21, spent $20,000 for the plastic surgery, she told an Orlando radio station.

Save for the recent acquisition of Beats, Apple usually performs so-called \"acquihires,\" or purchases made for talent, not a brand name. The publication speculates that Path may make its way into iOS Messages.\n\nPando Daily also points out that Path cofounder Dave Morin was seen sitting in the front row at Flint Center for Tuesday's iPhone 6 keynote. Apple saves those seats for high-ranking executives and special guests. For example, during the presentation, Jony Ive was seen sitting with design superstar and new Apple employee Marc Newson.\n\nPricing went unmentioned, but the struggling social networking firm's recent round of funding reportedly clocked in at a sub-$400 million valuation, much less than a rumored $500 million valuation sought by executives. Further, Path is not a high-ranking title in the iOS App Store and currently sits below the top-1,000 downloaded apps.\n\nAside from being one of the less popular social networking services, Path had a few missteps that drew scrutiny from governmental regulatory agencies and even Apple itself. In 2012, the firm was dinged for uploading users' address books without permission, claiming the automated action was meant to more easily find other friends using the app. The issue snowballed into a U.S. Federal Trade Commission investigation, which was ultimately settled for $800,000 in early 2013.\n\nOn the day Path's settlement, a researcher discover a flaw in the app's backend that geotagged photos uploaded by users. The problem was quickly patched, but shortly thereafter Path was again accused of unacceptable contacts handling techniques.\n\nDespite its troubles, Path has been featured in the iOS App Store and most recently broke off its in-app messaging feature as a standalone app called Path Talk.","It wasn\u2019t very long ago that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was treating talk of expansion as though he was being asked if he\u2019d like an epidemic of Ebola.\n\nBut recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if, but when.\n\nAnd then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two?\n\nSources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.\n\nAnd given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago, this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed.\n\nBut people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games couldn\u2019t be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous, so that posturing has fallen by the wayside.\n\nA new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and California\u2019s big three is all but assured, the only question being when and with which other city. Or should that be plural?\n\nWith all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing.\n\nAt the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink, but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city.\n\nAnd Bettman hasn\u2019t been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot.\n\nIt\u2019s been 15 years since the NHL expanded \u2014 and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west, taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense, the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced.\n\nAnd expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting, at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota.\n\nWhereas before the commissioner balked at expansion, this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest. We\u2019re hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City,\u201d Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games.\n\n\u201cWe have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest. It\u2019s not something we\u2019ve seriously considered yet.\u201d\n\nLike hell it isn\u2019t. They\u2019d have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously.\n\nAnd since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear \u2014 one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans. Once the league comes to your area, it is going to stay through thick, thin and the almost impossible, as seems to be the case in Phoenix.\n\nBut could that long-standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation? True there\u2019s a lease until 2028, but with the Panthers bleeding money, even the city of Sunrise can\u2019t seem to see the point of carrying on much longer, so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all.\n\nAnd while Kansas City isn\u2019t really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless they\u2019re going to stretch it to four teams, saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more U.S. cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen.\n\nGoing back to Minnesota has been a success, and there\u2019s no question there\u2019s more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec. Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity.\n\nThere will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent, of course, but even if it\u2019s true, after such a long wait this trivial detail \u2014 which only troubles the fans \u2014 isn\u2019t going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this.\n\nAnd any time the league decides it could use talent, they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game that\u2019s paying their salaries.\n\nExpansion will be happening, and soon. The only question is how many new cities will be involved.","BUTTE, Montana -\n\nRobert O\u2019Neill, the former United States Navy SEAL who shot and killed Osama Bin Laden, had his home mistakenly invaded by members of a street gang this morning shortly after 1AM. O\u2019Neill was uninjured, the five intruders all suffered injuries and remain hospitalized, but are expected to make a full recovery. Their names were not released in anticipation of the oncoming media storm.\n\nButte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington told members of the Associated Press in a brief press conference that the five men, part of a local street gang connected with the infamous Crips, were seeking to collect on a drug debt and invaded the wrong house, with the intended target just so happening to be the next door neighbor of O\u2019Neill\u2019s.\n\n\u201cMr. O\u2019Neill had just turned in for the night, but was awoken by a loud crash when his backdoor was abruptly kicked in. As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. O\u2019Neill used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. O\u2019Neill had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house!\u201d commissioner Harrington said as he chuckled.\n\nO\u2019Neill had little to say on the matter when Butte Daily Times journalist Kevin Williamson interviewed the celebrated war hero.\n\n\u201cIt was nothing really. Those kids didn\u2019t have their mission planned out properly and hit the wrong target. I hated to break their wrists and dislocate each of their knees like I did, but it was necessary in order to immobilize the invasion. I hope they get the money that is owed to them once they get out of jail and decide to live better lives. My main concern is getting my back door fixed. Those boys really did a number on the door jamb,\u201d O\u2019Neill stated.\n\nThe neighbor who was the intended target seems to have abandoned home and has not been found by police. According to the men in custody, the debt was over a $50 bag of marijuana.","Iraqi forces reach centre of northern city of Baiji in attempt to break the Isis siege of the country\u2019s biggest refinery\n\nAuthorities in Iraq were tonight investigating claims that the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been \u201ccritically injured\u201d in US-led air strikes, prompting speculation of his death.\n\nThe death of the elusive leader would mark a significant change in the US-led effort to curtail the Islamist extremist group. Britain\u2019s chief of the defence staff, General Sir Nicholas Houghton, warned, however, that the Isis leadership would regenerate even if Baghdadi had been killed.\n\nGeneral Houghton told the BBC: \u201cI can\u2019t absolutely confirm that Baghdadi has died. Even the Americans themselves are not yet in a position to do that. Probably it will take some days to have absolute confirmation.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s strikes destroyed an Isis convoy near the Iraqi city of Mosul, but US officials said it was unclear whether the group\u2019s top commander had been in any of the 10 targeted vehicles. Tribal sources told the Saudi news channel Al Arabiya that after the strike Isis members scrambled to transport the wounded to al-Qaim hospital which was overwhelmed with the injured.\n\nMeanwhile, Iraqi military forces reached the centre of the northern city of Baiji on Sunday, trying to break the Isis siege of the country\u2019s biggest refinery, outside the city. This led to fierce fighting. Sunni insurgents had seized Baiji in June, during a lightning advance through northern Iraq. Since then, they surrounded the refinery and halted its production, while a detachment of government troops inside has held out for months under siege.\n\nAn Iraqi colonel said troops had entered Baiji, a city of about 200,000 people, from the south and west and took over the al-Tamim neighbourhood and city centre. Isis had placed bombs along the roads and deployed snipers to keep the government forces from advancing \u2013 tactics used in other cities held by the ultra-hardline Sunni group, which controls swathes of both Iraq and Syria.","It's a safe bet that Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of Saudi Arabia's religious police, isn't a fan of Cole Porter. \"The lure of you\" is precisely why Nabet announced yesterday that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice will cover any women's eyes that are deemed \"tempting.\" \"The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones\" he said. \"[We] have the right to do so.\"\nWhat are \"tempting\" eyes? One Saudi journalist mused on condition of anonymity that they are \"uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble.\" The Orwellian-named committee did not provide a definition of tempting, but if they happen to rely on Merriam-Webster, then it means \"having an appeal.\" What is an appeal? According to the dictionary, it is \"arousing a sympathetic response.\" And what is sympathetic? \"Showing empathy,\" according to Merriam-Webster.\n\nSo there you have it. To allow a women's eyes to capture the unfettered glory of the world, one must empathize with her very existence. But the religious police--massively funded by King Abdullah--cannot do this. \"It's so stupid,\" the Saudi journalist tells me. \"I don't know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won't be silent.\"\n\nPerhaps they won't be, but the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has some of the most powerful backers in the country. Prince Naif, recently appointed heir to the throne, has said: \"The committee is supported by all sides ... It should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee.\" No surprise, then, that King Abdullah awarded this draconian body an additional 200 million riyals (about $53 million) in March.\n\nHow should America respond to this latest affront to Saudi women? Perhaps it can sponsor a contest of the most tempting eyes in Saudi Arabia. Women will send in pictures of their most tempting look and the winner will get to accompany President Obama during his next meeting with the Saudi dictator.\n\nIf Congress reconsidered the recent $60 billion U.S.-Saudi arms deal, the religious police might quickly find it \"tempting\" to stop treating women as property.","Gone are the days when Jason Alexander danced on the streets to celebrate McDonald's McDLT, and -- SO WE THOUGHT -- gone are the days when the McPizza (\"The pizza you won't believa!\") was hawked to awed fast-food patrons.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the company originally envisioned a device that can monitor heart rate, blood pressure and stress levels (based on the conductivity of the skin). Unfortunately, the sensors they tested just didn't pass muster, which isn't entirely surprising, since we've reviewed plenty of wearables with patchy heart rate monitors in the past. The company's engineers found that hairy arms, dry skin and even how tightly the watch is worn can affect the results, and they didn't find a solution in time.\n\nApple Watch became known as a black hole within the company, the WSJ's sources said, as it continued sucking in resources for four years despite all the failures during testing. Its development slowed down once the company realized that a health-focused watch that meets its standards will be very hard to build at this time. The lineup of watches due out in April are a lot different from the original one Apple envisioned and are more of an iPhone companion with a much simpler pulse monitor and pedometer.\n\nStill, the company's expecting to sell a ton, reportedly ordering around 6 million units from its Asian suppliers just for the first quarter.

Minor camera upgrades on each new generation of iPhone have kept consumers satisfied. But in 2014, the manufacturer introduced a bigger update: optical image stabilization and phase-detection autofocus on the iPhone 6 Plus. The camera on the iPhone 6 Plus in particular is said to be on par with the image quality of point-and-shoot cameras. The iPhone 6 did not get that feature.\n\nNow, Apple may provide the next iPhone with its largest camera upgrade in Apple\u2019s history. Information out of Apple\u2019s Asia supply chain has often been reliable in the past, and tallies with prior reports suggesting that Apple will put a camera in the new iPhone that will rival the image quality of DSLR cameras.

But Apple usually uses lenses by Sony.\n\nThe \"iPhone 6s\" may also implement a feature called Force Touch, according to the Taipei-based touch module supplier TPK. Force Touch lets the Apple Watch interpret different levels of pressure for different actions; a user can press heavily on the smartwatch screen to open an options menu, and then use a light tough to select an option.

Senior Lenovo executives at different times have indicated an interest in BlackBerry as a means to strengthen their own handset business.\n\nThe speculation reached a crescendo in the fall of 2013, when BlackBerry was exploring strategic alternatives.\n\nSources familiar with the situation however, told Reuters last year that the Canadian government had strongly hinted to BlackBerry that any sale to Lenovo would not win the necessary regulatory approvals due to security concerns.\n\nBlackBerry's secure networks manage the email traffic of thousands of large corporate customers, along with government and military agencies across the globe. Under Canadian law, any foreign takeover of BlackBerry would require government approval under the Industry Canada Act.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper told Reuters in February 2012 that he wanted BlackBerry to grow \"as a Canadian company.\" And in December 2011, then-Industry Minister Christian Paradis referred to the company as a \"Canadian jewel.\"\n\nAnalysts also have said any sale to Lenovo would face regulatory obstacles, but they have suggested that a sale of just BlackBerry's handset business and not its core network infrastructure might just pass muster with regulators.\n\nBlackBerry's long-struggling handset business turned a profit before special items in the last quarter, after the Waterloo, Ontario-based company concluded its three-year restructuring program.\n\nHowever, BlackBerry Chief Executive Officer John Chen has said he sees the handset business as core to the company for now, as it will foster sales growth over the next few quarters until the software and services business begins to generate new revenue streams in the first half of 2015.\n\nShares of BlackBerry were up 3.4 percent at $9.81 in early Nasdaq trading.

Apple had initially planned to begin making the larger version this quarter, people familiar those plans had said.This isn't the first time that rumors have hinted at delays for the iPad Pro. Apple was said to be targeting an early 2015 release date for the tablet last year, but those plans were reportedly put on hold. Back in October, The Wall Street Journal said that Apple had opted to delay mass production on the iPad in order to focus on iPhone 6 Plus production, and in November, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said production could be delayed until Q2 2015 because of difficulties related to the production of display components.

The youngsters would get down on all fours and scratch, bite, bark and kick each other. The winner of the match would then get to \"mate\" with a child as a reward. It was unknown if the children actually had sexual intercourse. That was done in imitation of the winning dogs mating with the female dogs.\n\nWillson stated while watching one video, if she closed her eyes and listened to the children fighting, the growls, barks, etc. sounded exactly like dogs in a canine dog fight.\n\nAs the children get older, Willson stated they become involved in the thefts of dogs, their training and in fights.

Whether engaging in airstrikes to push them out of key points of infrastructure like the Mosul Dam in Iraq, or targeting convoys to try to destabilize the terrorist organization, the fighting has been ongoing. And now, there are reports that the biggest target of all may have been struck: Iraqi defense minister Khaled al-Abadi has claimed that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was injured by American airstrikes Friday night, the first such reports of an actual brush between al-Baghdadi and U.S. forces.\n\nNot much is known about the background of al-Baghdadi, the self-proclaimed Caliph of the new Islamic State \u2014 he\u2019s believed to be in his early forties, and ascended to the top of ISIS back in 2010, but the vast majority of his personal biography is unclear. What\u2019s transparently clear, however, is the authority he asserts worldwide \u2014 ISIS\u2019 vision of a Caliphate, with al-Baghdadi sitting at the top, is one which all Muslims would be forced to recognize if the group had its way.\n\nIn short, they\u2019ve cut a fantastically bloody course through Iraq and Syria, killing Muslims, Christians and non-believers alike. They\u2019ve also notably released multiple videos of grisly hostage executions, including those of Americans Steven Sotloff and James Foley.\n\n\nAs always, caution is important. The U.S. hasn\u2019t confirmed these reports just yet, as Colonel Pat Ryder of CENTCOM told Fox News on Sunday, saying \u201dWe have no information to corroborate press reports that ISIL leader al-Baghdadi has been injured.\u201d On Saturday, Ryder did acknowledge that the airstrikes had gone down, however, hitting targets near Mosul.\n\nI can confirm that coalition aircraft did conduct a series of air strikes yesterday evening in Iraq against what was assessed to be a gathering of ISIL leaders near Mosul. We cannot confirm if ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was among those present.\n\nHopefully the situation will become clearer in the coming days \u2014 reports of al-Baghdadi\u2019s injury have been cited by multiple news outlets, including Israeli papers Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, British paper The Guardian, and Time, but until there\u2019s official word on the matter, it\u2019s best not to get too ahead of things. And it\u2019s also important not to assume that al-Baghdadi being injured, or even being killed, means that ISIS will fall apart.\n\nThe feeling of futility that sometimes comes with large-scale military battles against far-flung terrorist organizations comes from the ability of these groups to restructure and destabilize themselves, even when a leader dies \u2014 as demonstrated by the example of al-Qaeda and leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, for example, who\u2019s been in command long after the death of Osama bin Laden. Basically, whether al-Baghdadi is in charge or not, ISIS will likely remain a worrying and potent force in the region, and one which the U.S. won\u2019t be done engaging with.\n\nImages: ThoughtCatalog/Twitter","The President of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, has adopted a Jewish godson \u2013 to prevent him from becoming a werewolf.\n\nAlthough this sounds like something straight out of a fantasy novel, the President last week met Yair Tawil and his family for the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years and is based on Argentinian folklore.\n\nAccording to the legend, the seventh son of a family will transform into \u2018El Lobison\u2019, a werewolf like creature, on the first Friday after the boy\u2019s 13th Birthday, and will continue to turn into a blood-thirsty, baby eating werewolf every full moon.\n\nThe fear of the creature was so fervent in 19th century Argentina that many families murdered or abandoned their seventh born son, forcing the Argentinian government to implement the process of Presidential adoption.\n\nThe tradition was established in 1907, and was extended to baby girls in 1973.\n\nAlthough having seven children is now much rarer than 100 years ago, seventh sons or daughters can now expect to gain the President as their official godparent, as well as a gold medal and educational scholarship.\n\nThe President has said that Yair is the first Jewish boy to take part in the ceremony, as the tradition was exclusive to Catholic children until 2009.","A female Kurdish fighter, who was viewed as an iconic face of the Kurdish resistance movement, has been reportedly beheaded by ISIS.\n\nThe woman, known by the nickname \u2018Rehana\u2019 became a face of the conflict after a picture of her holding a rifle and making a V sign was posted on Twitter, receiving over 5,000 retweets.\n\nShe fought for the Kurdish Women\u2019s Defense Unit and claimed to have killed 100 ISIS militants.\n\nIt is now believed that Rehana may have been killed by IS militants after a picture circulated on Twitter, purporting to show her head being held aloft by a member of the jihadist organisation.\n\nHer death has not been confirmed, however, by the Women\u2019s Defense Unit.\n\nShe had been fighting to defend Kobane, a Syrian border town which has been under assault by ISIS for more than a month.\n\nMore than 10,000 women have helped to defend the town since the establishment of all female combat units in April.\n\nThey now reportedly play a major role in fighting against the IS.\n\nAnother female Kurdish fighter, who goes by the pseudonym of Afshin Kobani, said that the advancement of ISIS in Syria had forced to her to join the fight in Kobane.\n\n\u2018I lost many friends to this, and I decided there was a need to join up,\u2019\n\n\u2018This is our land \u2013 our own \u2013 and if we don\u2019t do it, who else will?\n\n\u2018We are just the same as men; there\u2019s no difference,\u2019 she said. \u2018We can do any type of job, including armed mobilisation.\u2019","WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump told France\u2019s new president that he was \u201cmy guy\u201d in the recent election, a French official said Thursday.

Trump also said he didn\u2019t endorse Le Pen, according to the official, who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and requested anonymity.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump may never have explicitly endorsed any candidate in France\u2019s election, but he had only nice things to say about one candidate: Le Pen. Whatever views he may have expressed privately are unknown.\n\nIn an April 21 interview with The Associated Press, Trump said he believed an attack that week on police officers in Paris would help the National Front leader because the violence played to her strengths.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the strongest on borders, and she\u2019s the strongest on what\u2019s been going on in France,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office interview. \u201cWhoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism, and whoever is the toughest at the borders, will do well in the election.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Trump never spoke publicly about Macron before the vote. Former President Barack Obama endorsed Macron.\n\nWhile Le Pen had echoed some of Trump\u2019s hardline rhetoric on immigration, the U.S. leader\u2019s words of support were surprising.\n\nLe Pen had distanced herself from her father, National Front party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, who has been convicted of crimes related to anti-Semitism and mocked the Holocaust as a \u201cdetail\u201d of history. But she still drew criticism for denying during the campaign that the French state was responsible for the roundup of Jews during World War II, and maintained an inner circle of old friends from her student days that included members of a radical group known for violence and anti-Semitism.\n\nTrump called Macron after his resounding victory. He also tweeted congratulations to the 39-year-old winner, saying he looked forward to working with him.","President Donald Trump congratulated newly-elected French president Emmanuel Macron, and in a brief photo-op at the US embassy in Brussels remarked on Macron\u2019s \u201ctremendous victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is my great honor to be with the newly elected president of France, who ran an incredible campaign and had a tremendous victory,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAll over the world they\u2019re talking about it, and we have a lot to discuss, including terrorism and other things.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations, great job,\u201d he added.\n\nAfter an intense handshake, Trump also reportedly told Macron he was his preferred candidate in the face-off between the now-president and his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen.\nThis comes as a surprise, given Trump\u2019s expression of support for Le Pen during the election campaign, which concluded with a Macron victory on May 7.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Trump said he thought Le Pen was the \u201cstrongest on borders,\u201d and \u201cthe strongest on what\u2019s been going on in France,\u201d though he stopped short of endorsing her.\n\nLe Pen had a similar campaign to Trump\u2019s successful 2016 bid, running on a fiercely anti-immigration platform packaged in populist rhetoric.

The next thing you hear: Eggs are bad for you\u2014as bad as cigarettes, in fact, according to a recent study in the journal Atherosclerosis.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s the deal on that new study. Researchers from Western University in Canada  examined over 1,200 men and women to come to the conclusion that regularly eating egg yolks was two-thirds as bad as smoking when it comes to carotid plaque in the arteries, a known risk factor for stroke and heart attack.\n\nBut before you ditch the eggs, experts point out that this study doesn\u2019t exactly give the whole picture. The main crack: The research shows an association between egg consumption and plaque buildup, rather than a cause-and-effect relationship, says cardiologist Gordon Tomaselli, MD from the American Heart Association. (In other words, there\u2019s no way to tell which came first, the plaque or the egg.) The study also didn\u2019t control for what else participants ate or take into account how much they exercised, which can play a big role in heart disease, Dr. Tomaselli says.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s interesting that the graphs of egg yolk consumption and smoking take a similar shape when looking at carotid plaque build-up, this study doesn\u2019t take into account the many other adverse effects of smoking, namely high blood pressure and lung cancer,\u201d says Dr. Tomaselli.\n\nAnd your rise-and-shine scramble has more to it than just cholesterol: \u201cEggs contain many other nutrients, including unsaturated fats, which may be beneficial in preventing cardiovascular disease,\u201d says Gregg Fonarow, MD, of UCLA Cardiology. \u201cWhether the net effect of egg consumption is beneficial, neutral, or harmful requires assessing more than just measuring the cholesterol content of egg yolk,\u201d he says.\n\nHere, the bottom line on how to eat eggs healthily:\n\n1. Skip the three-egg omelet. It\u2019s safest to limit your egg consumption to one a day. The American Heart Association recommends that most people limit their daily cholesterol intake to 300 milligrams, and one yolk contains about 185 milligrams. If a single-egg scramble simply won\u2019t cut it, eat extra whites. \u201cThis way you\u2019ll get the protein from the whites without the added cholesterol of the yolk,\u201d says Dr. Tomaselli.\n\n2. Hold the bacon. One of the biggest oversights of this study is that it didn\u2019t account for the other foods in a person\u2019s diet\u2014and anyone who\u2019s ever ordered a Grand Slam knows that eggs usually come with side dishes that aren\u2019t exactly good for you, says Marisa Moore, RD, from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Her advice? Pair your egg with fresh fruit, whole grain toast, and veggies instead of fennel sausage, a greasy hash, and bacon.\n\n3. Snack smart. That cookie you\u2019ve got your eye on? Well that has egg in it too. \u201cYou have to be cognizant that other dishes contain eggs and cholesterol,\u201d says Dr. Tomaselli. When your next snack attack rolls around, reach for a handful of nuts, which are rich in heart-healthy Vitamin E, monounsaturated fats, and fiber. (Check out 5 more high-protein snacks.)\n\n4. Put \u2019em out to pasture. It pays to be choosy about which type of eggs you pick up at the supermarket. A 2010 study from Penn State University showed that hens who were kept outside on pastures rather than in a cage laid eggs that had twice as much vitamin E and 2.5 times the amount of omega-3 fatty acids than the eggs from  their cooped-up counterparts. To make sure you\u2019ve got the right ones, look for the word \u201cpastured\u201d on the carton. And as always, organic is best. (See what you can do to make hens\u2014and your eggs\u2014healthier and happier with Happier Hens On The Horizon.) ","Is your breakfast omelet harming your heart? A recent study by researchers at Western University in Canada found that the more egg yolks people ate, the thicker their artery walls became \u2014 an indicator of heart disease risk \u2014 and that the effect was almost as bad as from smoking cigarettes.\n\nIn the study, the researchers measured carotid plaque build-up in the arteries of 1,231 men and women, average age 62, who were seeking care at cardiovascular-health clinics. Participants filled out questionnaires detailing lifestyle habits including medication use, cigarette smoking and egg-yolk consumption. The researchers gauged how much people smoked and how many egg yolks they ate over time, by calculating their \u201cpack-years\u201d (the number of packs of cigarettes people smoked per day multiplied by the number of years they spent smoking) and \u201cegg-yolk years\u201d (how many egg yolks they ate per week for how many years).\n\nAfter about age 40, participants\u2019 plaque began building up steadily, but among the participants who ate the most eggs \u2014 three or more yolks per week \u2014 that build-up increased \u201cexponentially,\u201d the study found. As people\u2019s egg-yolk years went up, so did their plaque accumulation \u2014 an association that was independent of factors like gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking, body mass index and diabetes.\n\n(MORE: Good News, Kids Cholesterol Levels Are Down)\n\nAmong the 20% of participants who ate the most eggs, the carotid plaque build-up was about two-thirds that of the study\u2019s heaviest smokers. The researchers concluded that the plaque increase from eating eggs \u201cfollows a similar pattern to that of cigarette smoking.\u201d\n\nArterial accumulation of plaque is a key risk factor for heart attack and stroke. As plaque builds up, it thickens artery walls and narrows the space through which blood can flow, forcing the heart to pump harder. If plaques become unstable, they can break off and form clots, which can halt blood flow to either the brain or the heart, causing stroke or heart attack.\n\nThe authors argue that their findings should quell doubts over the link between high dietary cholesterol and heart disease. \u201cThe prevailing tendency to ignore dietary cholesterol as a risk factor for coronary heart disease requires reassessment, including the consumption of cholesterol from eggs,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nThe government\u2019s dietary guidelines recommend that adults consume no more than 300 mg of cholesterol a day. One whole egg contains about 180 mg of cholesterol, nearly two-thirds of your daily recommended ma.\n\n\u201cThe mantra \u2018eggs can be part of a healthy diet for healthy people\u2019 has confused the issue. It has been known for a long time that a high cholesterol intake increases the risk of cardiovascular events, and egg yolks have a very high cholesterol content,\u201d study author Dr. David Spence, a professor of neurology at western\u2019s Schulich School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry, said in a statement. \u201cIn diabetics, an egg a day increases coronary risk by two- to five-fold.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Atherosclerosis.","PROBLEM: Last year, the average American consumed 247 eggs -- over 40 percent more than the world per-capita average. Because egg yolks are high in cholesterol, eating whole eggs increases cholesterol, a known risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart attacks. Previous research also links CAD with cigarette smoke.\n\nMETHODOLOGY: Canadian researchers examined 1,231 patients at London's Health Sciences Centre's University Hospital. The average age of all the patients was 62. Ultrasound measurements of the carotid arteries established the presence and quantity of atherosclerotic plaque, and the scans were accompanied by lifestyle surveys. Smoking was measured in pack-years (number of packs per day multiplied by the number of years spent smoking). Egg yolk consumption was measured in egg yolk-years.\n\nRESULTS: Aging was associated with a linear increase in arterial plaque after age 40, but smoking and egg consumption were each independently associated with an exponential increase in plaque. Egg consumption had two-thirds of the effect of smoking.\n\nCONCLUSION: Egg yolks are almost as bad for your carotid arteries as smoking.\n\nIMPLICATION: While the link between eggs and cholesterol -- and between cholesterol and heart disease -- is well established, this study sheds light on the extent of their potential harm if eaten routinely in large quantities. A single large egg contains more than 180 mg of cholesterol -- more than a third of a person's daily recommended intake. By this measure, a typical American breakfast alone, with two eggs (plus bacon!), would push well past that. Egg whites, meanwhile, remain excellent.\n\nSOURCE: The full study, \"Egg Yolk Consumption and Carotid Plaque,\" is published in the journal Atherosclerosis.","Remember the \u201870s when doctors equated eggs with cholesterol and heart disease? A recent Canadian study involving over 1,200 adults published in the peer-reviewed journal Atherosclerosis says that eating eggs yolks is about as bad as smoking cigarettes when it comes to advancing coronary heart disease. We\u2019re already seeing cracks in the theory.\n\nIn the study, researchers recorded the number of eggs eaten and packs of cigarettes smoked as recalled by each adult (average age 62).  Everyone in the study had been referred to a vascular prevention clinic at a Canadian hospital, meaning their heart health (and the habits that led them there) was already in question. The researchers found that, as expected, plaque build-up in their subjects\u2019 carotid artery thickened with age, and even correlated with smoking and egg-eating habits.\n\n\nPublications like The Daily Mail and Fox News have reported blindly on the matter, but thankfully there are others out there suspiciously raising eyebrows.\n\nThe UK\u2019s National Health Service points out some of the study\u2019s limitations, including:\n\nThe accuracy of the participants\u2019 recollections of egg yolk consumption.\nA lack of details regarding how the eggs were cooked (or not).\nDisregard for other factors of heart disease advancement, including but not limited to exercise, alcohol consumption, antidepressant use (antidepressants have been shown to cause arteries to thicken 400% faster than aging,) and other important dietary factors.\nNeither the study in question nor the NHS takes into consideration, however:\n\nThe harmful effects of the chemicals and hormones found in non-organic eggs.\nThe effects on the human body from eating eggs from chicken given GMO feed.\nThe living condition of the chickens.\nNon-organic eggs can contain the same antibiotics, chemicals, and hormones administered to conventional chickens. Add GMO feed, polluted water, and unsanitary living conditions to these chickens, and you may have eggs that are little more than hard-shelled pellets of poison.\n\nOrganic eggs from healthy chickens on GMO-free feed have actually shown in many studies to prevent heart disease. They contain healthful amounts of protein, vitamin B, omega-3 fatty acids, and many nutrients like lutein and zeaxanthin, which reduce risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a major cause of blindness.\n\nThe key? Moderation, as with most things, and buying organic eggs from local farmers who can raise their chickens in truly cage-free conditions. Happy, healthy chickens produce more healthful eggs.","Conventional medical authorities say that consumption of saturated animal fats is bad for you and causes heart disease.\n\nBut a hundred years ago, fewer than than one in one hundred Americans were obese, and coronary heart disease was unknown.\n\nThe Procter and Gamble started marketing Crisco as a new kind of food -- the first commercially marketed trans fat. Crisco was originally used to make candles and soap, but with electrification causing a decline in candle sales,\n\nProcter and Gamble decided to promote the fat as a \u201chealthier\u201d all-vegetable-derived shortening\n\nAccording to LewRockwell.com:\n\n\u201cFeeding high doses of fat and cholesterol to omnivores, like rats and dogs, does not produce atherosclerotic lesions in them ...\n\nIn fact, it turns out that people who have highest percentage of saturated fat in their diets have the lowest risk of heart disease ...\n\nThe last word on this subject should go to Julia Child ... Enjoy eating saturated fats, they\u2019re good for you!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Mercola's Comments:\nThe demonization of saturated fat began in 1953, when Dr. Ancel Keys published a paper comparing saturated fat intake and heart disease mortality. His theory turned out to be flimsy, to say the least, but the misguided ousting of saturated fat has continued unabated ever since. Fortunately, the truth is finally starting to come out, as medical scientists have begun to seriously question Keys' findings.\n\nTime to Put Ancel Keys' Theory to Rest\nKeys based his theory on a study of six countries, in which higher saturated fat intake equated to higher rates of heart disease. However, he conveniently ignored data from 16 other countries that did not fit his theory. Had he chosen a different set of countries, the data would have shown that increasing the percent of calories from fat reduces the number of deaths from coronary heart disease.\n\nAnd, as illustrated in the featured article, when you include all 22 countries for which data was available at the time of his study, you find that those who consume the highest percentage of saturated fat have the lowest risk of heart disease.\n\nFurthermore, many have now realized that it's the trans fat found in margarine, vegetable shortening, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils that is the true villain, causing far more significant health problems than saturated fat ever could!\n\nStill, despite the scientific evidence, the low-fat dogma remains a favorite among most government health authorities. Case in point: the most recent food chart issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in December of last year, recommends reducing your saturated fat intake to a mere seven percent of caloric intake\u2014down from its previously recommended 10 percent\u2026\n\nNewer Studies Debunk Keys' Theory\nThe USDA's lowered recommendation is illogical when you consider the evidence available today, which supports saturated fat as a necessary part of a heart healthy diet. For example, as discussed in the featured article, a number of indigenous tribes around the world are living proof that a high-saturated fat diet equates to low mortality from heart disease.\n\nThese include:\n\nTribe Primary Diet Percentage Saturated Fat\nMaasai tribe in Kenya/Tanzania Meat, milk, cattle blood 66 percent\nInuit Eskimos in the Arctic Whale meat and blubber 75 percent\nRendille tribe in NE Kenya Camel milk, meat, blood 63 percent\nTokealu, atoll islands in New Zealand territory Fish and coconuts 60 percent\nAnd then there's human breast milk, which contains 54 percent saturated fat. Since breast milk is the most perfect diet in existence for developing infants, the presence of high amounts of saturated fat cannot easily be construed as a \"mistake.\"\n\nFurthermore:\n\nA meta-analysis published last year, which pooled data from 21 studies and included nearly 348,000 adults, found no difference in the risks of heart disease and stroke between people with the lowest and highest intakes of saturated fat.\nIn a 1992 editorial published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, Dr. William Castelli, a former director of the Framingham Heart study, stated:\n\n\"In Framingham, Mass., the more saturated fat one ate, the more cholesterol one ate, the more calories one ate, the lower the person's serum cholesterol. The opposite of what\u2026 Keys et al would predict\u2026We found that the people who ate the most cholesterol, ate the most saturated fat, ate the most calories, weighed the least and were the most physically active.\"\nAnother 2010 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a reduction in saturated fat intake must be evaluated in the context of replacement by other macronutrients, such as carbohydrates.\n\nWhen you replace saturated fat with a higher carbohydrate intake, particularly refined carbohydrate, you exacerbate insulin resistance and obesity, increase triglycerides and small LDL particles, and reduce beneficial HDL cholesterol. The authors state that dietary efforts to improve your cardiovascular disease risk should primarily emphasize the limitation of refined carbohydrate intake, and weight reduction.\nI believe that last point is very important, and is likely a major key for explaining the rampant increase in obesity, heart disease and diabetes. And once you can pinpoint the problem, turning it all around becomes that much easier.\n\nCarbohydrates, Not Fat, is the Root of Obesity and Heart Disease\nHeart disease is so common today, it's hard for people to remember that a mere 100 years ago, this disease was really uncommon.  As Dr. Donald Miller writes in the featured article:\n\n\"There were 500 cardiologists practicing in the U.S. in 1950. There are 30,000 of them now \u2013 a 60-fold increase for a population that has only doubled since 1950.\"\n\nSuch an explosion of heart disease indicates that something has changed that is contributing to this epidemic.\n\nWhat is that \"something\"?\n\nOur diet!\n\nMost likely, the studies that have linked the so-called \"Western diet\" to an increased heart disease risk simply confirm that sugar and refined carbohydrates are harmful to your heart health. Because although the Western diet is high in red and processed meats and saturated fats, it's also alarmingly high in sugar and refined carbs like bread and pasta. And, as concluded in the last study listed above, when you reduce saturated fat and increase refined carbohydrates, you end up promoting obesity, heart disease and diabetes...\n\nGary Taubes has also done an excellent job of explaining the connection between carbs and obesity and its related health issues in his book Why We Get Fat: and what to do about it.\n\nIn a nutshell, eating fat and protein does not make you fat\u2014carbohydrates do.I firmly believe the two primary keys for successful weight management and reducing your risk for diabetes, heart disease and other weight-related health problems are:\n\nSeverely restricting carbohydrates (sugars, fructose, and grains) in your diet, and\nIncreasing healthy fat consumption\nAccording to last year's Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the top 10 sources of calories in the American diet are:\n\nGrain-based desserts (cakes, cookies, donuts, pies, crisps, cobblers, and granola bars) 139 calories a day\nAlcoholic beverages\nYeast breads, 129 calories a day\nPasta and pasta dishes\nChicken and chicken-mixed dishes, 121 calories a day\nMexican mixed dishes\nSoda, energy drinks, and sports drinks, 114 calories a day\nBeef and beef-mixed dishes\nPizza, 98 calories a day\nDairy desserts\n\nLooking at this list, it plain to see that CARBS\u2014i.e. sugars (primarily fructose) and grains\u2014are the primary sources of our weight- and health problems, not saturated fats.\n\n(As an update, you've often heard me state that soda is the number one source of calories in the US diet, which it was\u2014based on the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The updated NHANES survey above covers nutritional data from 2005-2006, placing grain-based foods in the top two slots. Still, soda comes in at number four, and I still believe a lot of people, particularly teenagers, probably get a majority of their calories from fructose-rich drinks like soda.)\n\nThe Different Types of Fat\nFats can be confusing, but you can generally divide fats into four types:\n\nSaturated fats, from animal fat and tropical oils\nMonounsaturated fat, such as olive oil\nPolyunsaturated fat, such as omega-3 and omega-6 fats\nTrans fats, such as margarine\nSources of healthy fats include:\n\nOlives and Olive oil Coconuts and coconut oil Butter made from raw grass-fed organic milk\nRaw Nuts, such as, almonds or pecans Organic pastured egg yolks Avocados\nGrass fed meats Palm oil Unheated organic nut oils\nAnother healthful fat you want to be mindful of is animal-based omega-3. Deficiency in this essential fat can cause or contribute to very serious health problems, both mental and physical, and may be a significant underlying factor of up to 96,000 premature deaths each year. For more information about omega-3's and the best sources of this fat, please review this previous article.\n\nHaving the proper balance between omega-3 and omega-6 fats is also very important for optimal health. So in addition to increasing your omega-3 (which most people are sorely deficient in), you also want to decrease your consumption of omega-6, found primarily in:\n\nCorn oil\nSoy oil\nCanola oil\nSafflower oil\nSunflower oil\nThe ideal ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 is 1:1, but the typical American diet is more like 1:20 in favor of omega-6. The overabundance of these oils in processed foods of all kinds explains our excess omega-6 levels.\n\nThe other fats you want to avoid are the trans fats. Trans fats are formed when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil during food processing in order to make it solidify. This process, known as hydrogenation, makes fats less likely to spoil, so foods stay fresh longer, have a longer shelf life and also have a less greasy feel. The end result of the hydrogenation process is a completely unnatural fat that causes dysfunction and chaos in your body on a cellular level.\n\nYour Body NEEDS Saturated Fat for Optimal Function\nSaturated fats from animal and vegetable sources provide a number of important health benefits. In fact, your body cannot function without saturated fats! Saturated fats are needed for the proper function of your:\n\nCell membranes Heart Bones (to assimilate calcium)\nLiver Lungs Hormones\nImmune system Satiety (reducing hunger) Genetic regulation\nHealthy Fat Tips to Live By\nSo please remember, you do need a certain amount of healthy fat, while at the same time you'll want to avoid the unhealthy varieties. The easiest way to accomplish this is to simply eliminate processed foods, which are high in all things detrimental to your health: sugar, carbs, and dangerous types of fats.\n\nAfter that, these tips can help ensure you're eating the right fats for your health:\n\nUse organic butter made from raw grass-fed milk instead of margarines and vegetable oil spreads. Butter is a healthy whole food that has received an unwarranted bad rap.\nUse coconut oil for cooking. It is far superior to any other cooking oil and is loaded with health benefits. (Remember that olive oil should be used COLD, drizzled over salad or fish, for example, not to cook with.)\nFollowing my nutrition plan will automatically reduce your modified fat intake, as it will teach you to focus on healthy whole foods instead of processed junk food.\nTo round out your healthy fat intake, be sure to eat raw fats, such as those from avocados, raw dairy products, and olive oil, and also take a high-quality source of animal-based omega-3 fat, such as krill oil.","We\u2019ve been told that saturated fat is unhealthy.\n\nIt is claimed to raise cholesterol levels and give us heart attacks.\n\nHowever\u2026 many recent studies suggest that the true picture is more complicated than that.\n\nThis article takes a detailed look at saturated fat and whether it is good or bad for your health.\n\nWhat is Saturated Fat?\n\n\u201cFats\u201d are macronutrients.\n\nThat is, nutrients that we consume in large amounts and give us energy.\n\nEach fat molecule is made of one glycerol molecule and three fatty acids\u2026 which can be either saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated.\n\nWhat this \u201csaturation\u201d stuff has to do with, is the number of double bonds in the molecule.\n\nSaturated fatty acids have no double bonds, monounsaturated fatty acids have one double bond and polyunsaturated fatty acids have two or more double bonds.\n\nThis picture here shows the difference:\n\nSaturated vs Unsaturated Fatty AcidsPhoto Source.\n\nAnother way to phrase this, is that saturated fatty acids have all their carbon (C) atoms fully \u201csaturated\u201d with hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\nFoods that are high in saturated fat include fatty meats, lard, full-fat dairy products like butter and cream, coconuts, coconut oil, palm oil and dark chocolate.\n\nActually, \u201cfats\u201d contain a combination of different fatty acids. No fat is pure saturated fat, or pure mono- or polyunsaturated.\n\nEven foods like beef also contain a significant amount of mono- and polyunsaturated fats (1).\n\nFats that are mostly saturated (like butter) tend to be solid at room temperature, while fats that are mostly unsaturated (like olive oil) are liquid at room temperature.\n\nLike other fats, saturated fat contains 9 calories per gram.\n\nBottom Line: Saturated \u201cfats\u201d are fats that contain a high proportion of saturated fatty acids, which contain no double bonds. Saturated fats are solid at room temperature.\nWhy do People Think That it is Harmful?\n\nA Single Butter Curl\n\nBack in the 20th century, there was a major epidemic of heart disease running rampant in America.\n\nIt used to be a rare disease, but very quickly it skyrocketed and became the number one cause of death\u2026 which it still is (2).\n\nResearchers learned that eating saturated fat seemed to increase levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream.\n\nThis was an important finding at the time, because they also knew that having high cholesterol was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.\n\nThis led to the following assumption being made:\n\nIf saturated fat raises cholesterol (A causes B) and cholesterol causes heart disease (B causes C), then this must mean that saturated fat causes heart disease (A causes C).\n\nHowever, at the time, this was not based on any experimental evidence in humans.\n\nThis hypothesis (called the \u201cdiet-heart hypothesis\u201d) was based on assumptions, observational data and animal studies (3).\n\nThe diet-heart hypothesis then turned into public policy in 1977, before it was ever proven to be true (4).\n\nEven though we now have plenty of experimental data in humans showing these initial assumptions to be wrong, people are still being told to avoid saturated fat in order to reduce heart disease risk.\n\nBottom Line: Saturated fats have been assumed to cause heart disease by raising cholesterol in the blood. However, no experimental evidence has ever directly linked saturated fat to heart disease.\nSaturated Fat Can Raise LDL (The \u201cBad\u201d) Cholesterol, But Also HDL (The \u201cGood\u201d) Cholesterol\n\nIt\u2019s important to realize that the word \u201ccholesterol\u201d is often used inaccurately.\n\nOlder Male Doctor\n\nHDL and LDL, the \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d cholesterols, aren\u2019t actually cholesterol\u2026 they are proteins that carry cholesterol around, known as lipoproteins.\n\nLDL stands for Low Density Lipoprotein and HDL stands for High Density Lipoprotein. All \u201ccholesterol\u201d is identical.\n\nAt first, scientists only measured \u201cTotal\u201d cholesterol, which includes cholesterol within both LDL and HDL. Later they learned that while LDL was linked to increased risk, HDL was linked to reduced risk (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).\n\n\u201cTotal\u201d cholesterol is actually a highly flawed marker because it also includes HDL. So having a high HDL (protective) actually contributes to a high \u201cTotal\u201d cholesterol.\n\nBecause saturated fat raised LDL levels, it seemed logical to assume that this would increase the risk of heart disease. But scientists mostly ignored the fact that saturated fat also raises HDL.\n\nAll that being said, new research has shown that LDL isn\u2019t necessarily \u201cbad\u201d because there are different subtypes of LDL (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16):\n\nSmall, dense LDL: These are small lipoproteins that can penetrate the arterial wall easily, which drives heart disease.\nLarge LDL: These lipoproteins are large and fluffy and don\u2019t easily penetrate the arteries.\nThe small, dense particles are also much more susceptible to becoming oxidized, which is a crucial step in the heart disease process (17, 18, 19).\n\nPeople with mostly small LDL particles have three times greater risk of heart disease, compared to those with mostly large LDL particles (20).\n\nSo\u2026 if we want to reduce our risk of heart disease, we want to have mostly large LDL particles and as little of the small ones as possible.\n\nHere\u2019s an interesting bit of information that is often ignored by \u201cmainstream\u201d nutritionists\u2026 eating saturated fat changes the LDL particles from small, dense to Large (21, 22, 23).\n\nWhat this implies is that even though saturated fat can mildly raise LDL, they are changing the LDL to a benign subtype that is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.\n\nEven the effects of saturated fat on LDL aren\u2019t as dramatic as you may think. Although they increase LDL in the short-term, plenty of long-term observational studies find no link between saturated fat consumption and LDL levels (24, 25, 26).\n\nIt also seems to depend on the \u201cchain length\u201d of the fatty acid. For example, palmitic acid (16 carbons) may raise LDL, while stearic acid (18 carbons) does not (27).\n\nNow scientists have realized that it\u2019s not just about the LDL concentration or the size of the particles, but the number of LDL particles (called LDL-p) floating in the bloodstream.\n\nLow-carb diets, which tend to be high in saturated fat, can lower LDL-p, while low-fat diets can have an adverse effect and raise LDL-p (28, 29, 30, 31).\n\nBottom Line: Saturated fats raise HDL (the \u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol and change LDL from small, dense (bad) to Large LDL, which is mostly benign. Overall, saturated fats do not harm the blood lipid profile like previously believed.\nDoes Saturated Fat Cause Heart Disease?\n\nOld Man Taking Pills\n\nThe supposedly harmful effects of saturated fat are the cornerstone of modern dietary guidelines.\n\nBecause of that, this topic has received enormous amounts of funding.\n\nHowever\u2026 despite decades of research and billions of dollars spent, scientists still haven\u2019t been able to demonstrate a clear link.\n\nSeveral recent review studies that combined data from multiple other studies, found that there really is no link between saturated fat consumption and heart disease.\n\nThis includes a review of 21 studies with a total of 347,747 participants, published in 2010. Their conclusion: there is absolutely no association between saturated fat and heart disease (32).\n\nAnother review published in 2014 looked at data from 76 studies (both observational studies and controlled trials) with a total of 643,226 participants. They found no link between saturated fat and heart disease (33).\n\nWe also have a systematic review from the Cochrane collaboration, which combines data from numerous randomized controlled trials.\n\nAccording to their review, published in 2011, reducing saturated fat has no effect on death or death from heart disease (34).\n\nHowever, they found that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats reduced the risk of cardiac events (but not death) by 14%.\n\nThis does not imply that saturated fats are \u201cbad,\u201d just that certain types of unsaturated fats (mostly Omega-3s) are protective, while saturated fats are neutral.\n\nSo\u2026 the biggest and best studies on saturated fat and heart disease show that there is no direct link. It was a myth all along.\n\nUnfortunately, the governments and \u201cmainstream\u201d health organizations seem reluctant to change their minds and continue to promote the old low-fat dogma.\n\nFor more, read this review of 5 recent studies on saturated fat and health.\n\nBottom Line: The link between saturated fat and heart disease has been studied intensely for decades, but the biggest and best studies show that there is no statistically significant association.\nDoes a Diet Low in Saturated Fat Have Any Health Benefits, or Help You Live Longer?\n\nFrustrated Young Woman With Vegetables on a Plate\n\nSeveral massive studies have been conducted on the low-fat diet.\n\nThis is the diet recommended by the USDA and mainstream health organizations all over the world.\n\nThe main purpose of this diet, is to reduce the intake of saturated fat and cholesterol.\n\nThis diet also recommends increased consumption of fruits, vegetables and whole grains\u2026 along with reduced consumption of sugar.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Health Initiative was the biggest nutrition study in history. It was a randomized controlled trial with 46,835 women, who were instructed to eat a low-fat diet.\n\nAfter 7.5-8 years, there was only 0.4 kg (1 pound) difference in weight and there was zero difference in heart disease, cancer or death (35, 36, 37, 38).\n\nOther massive studies have confirmed this\u2026 the low-fat diet provides no benefit for heart disease or the risk of death (39, 40).\n\nSeveral studies that replaced saturated fat with polyunsaturated vegetable oils showed that more people in the vegetable oil groups ended up dying (41, 42).\n\nIt is interesting to see that since the low-fat guidelines came out, the prevalence of obesity has skyrocketed (43):\n\nLow Fat Guidelines and Obesity Epidemic\n\nThis graph shows that the obesity epidemic started full-force at the same time the low-fat advice was peaking. The type 2 diabetes epidemic followed soon after.\n\nOf course, this graph alone doesn\u2019t prove anything (correlation does not equal causation), but it does make sense that replacing traditional foods like butter and meat with processed low-fat foods high in sugar had something to do with it.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting when looking at the literature, that in almost every single study comparing the \u201cexpert approved\u201d low-fat diet to other diets (including paleo, vegan, low-carb and Mediterranean), it loses (44, 45, 46, 47).\n\nBottom Line: Studies on the low-fat diet do not show a reduced risk of heart disease or death and some studies show that replacing saturated fat with vegetable oils increases the risk.\nPeople With Certain Medical Conditions May Want to Minimize Saturated Fat\n\nSuspicious Doctor\n\nThe results of most studies are based on averages.\n\nThe studies clearly show that, on average, saturated fat does not raise the risk of heart disease.\n\nHowever, within those averages, there is room for individual variability.\n\nPerhaps most individuals see no effect\u2026 while others experience decreased risk and yet others experience an increased risk.\n\nThat being said, there are definitely some people who may want to minimize saturated fat in the diet.\n\nThis includes individuals with a genetic disorder called Familial Hypercholesterolemia, as well as people who have a gene variant called ApoE4 (48).\n\nWith time, the science of genetics will most surely discover more ways in which diet affects our individual risk for disease.\n\nBottom Line: Some people may want to minimize saturated fat intake, including people with Familial Hypercholesterolemia or a gene called ApoE4.\nSaturated Fat is Excellent for Cooking and Foods That Are High in it Tend to be Healthy and Nutritious\n\nSaturated fat has some important beneficial aspects that are rarely mentioned.\n\nChef Holding Bell Pepper and Meat\n\nFor example, saturated fats are excellent for cooking. Because they have no double bonds, they are highly resistant to heat-induced damage (49).\n\nPolyunsaturated fats, on the other hand, easily oxidize when they\u2019re heated (50).\n\nFor this reason, coconut oil, lard and butter are all excellent choices for cooking, especially for high-heat cooking methods like frying.\n\nFoods that are naturally high in saturated fat also tend to be healthy and nutritious, as long as you\u2019re eating quality unprocessed foods.\n\nThese include naturally fed/raised meats, dairy products from grass-fed cows, dark chocolate and coconuts.\n\nBottom Line: Saturated fats are excellent cooking fats and foods that are high in saturated fat tend to be both healthy and nutritious.\nThe \u201cBad\u201d Fats You Should Avoid Like The Plague\n\nBottles of Vegetable Oil\n\nThere are many different types of fat.\n\nSome of them are good for us, others neutral, yet others are clearly harmful.\n\nThe evidence points to saturated and monounsaturated fats being perfectly safe and maybe even downright healthy.\n\nHowever\u2026 the situation is a bit more complicated with polyunsaturated fats.\n\nWhen it comes to those, we have both Omega-3s and Omega-6s.\n\nWe need to get these two types of fatty acids in a certain balance, but most people are eating way too many Omega-6 fatty acids these days (51).\n\nIt is a good idea to eat plenty of Omega-3s (such as from fatty fish), but most people would do best by reducing their Omega-6 consumption (52).\n\nThe best way to do that is to avoid seed- and vegetable oils like soybean and corn oils, as well as the processed foods that contain them.\n\nAnother class of fats, artificial trans fats, is also very harmful.\n\nTrans fats are made by exposing polyunsaturated vegetable oils to a chemical process that involves high heat, hydrogen gas and a metal catalyst.\n\nStudies show that trans fats lead to insulin resistance, inflammation, belly fat accumulation and drastically raise the risk of heart disease (53, 54, 55, 56).\n\nSo eat your saturated fats, monounsaturated fats and Omega-3s\u2026 but avoid trans fats and processed vegetable oils like the plague.\n\nBottom Line: The truly harmful fats are artificial trans fats and processed vegetable oils high in Omega-6 fatty acids.\nBlaming New Health Problems on Old Foods Doesn\u2019t Make Sense\n\nThe health authorities have spent an immense amount of resources studying the link between saturated fat and heart disease.\n\nDespite thousands of scientists, decades of work and billions of dollars spent, this hypothesis still hasn\u2019t been supported by any good evidence.\n\nThe saturated fat myth wasn\u2019t proven in the past, isn\u2019t proven today and never will be proven\u2026 because it\u2019s just flat out wrong.\n\nNot only is this myth NOT supported by scientific evidence, it is easily refuted with some plain common sense\u2026\n\nHumans and pre-humans have been eating saturated fat for hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of years, but the heart disease epidemic started a hundred years ago.\n\nBlaming new health problems on old foods just doesn\u2019t make sense."," Saturated fats have long been called ''bad fats'' for their effect on the heart. But a new analysis calls into question whether they're really that bad after all.\n\nThe findings, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, have sparked renewed debate about fats and heart health.\n\nThe new study should trigger a review of current diet guidelines for heart health, according to the researchers who did the analysis. Other experts, including one from the American Heart Association, disagree.\n\nThere is some common ground. All agree that dietary fat is just one factor that drives heart disease risk. Paying attention to the other factors is also important.\n\nWebMD asked a study co-author, a cardiologist, a nutrition expert, and the American Heart Association to elaborate.\n\nWhat did the analysis look at and find?\n\nResearchers looked at 72 published studies on fats and heart disease. The studies involved more than 600,000 people from 18 countries. Some people already had heart disease, while others did not. The researchers reanalyzed the results, an approach called a meta-analysis.\n\nThey looked at whether different fats helped or hurt your heart. The different fats included:\n\nSaturated fats (found in meats, whole-fat dairy products, and baked goods)\nPolyunsaturated fats, such as omega-3 and omega-6 (found in fish, nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils)\nMonounsaturated fats (found in olive and canola oils)\nTrans fats (found in fried foods and baked goods, and being phased out of the food supply)\nThe surprise? Saturated fats, long thought to raise heart disease risks, had no effect. Neither did monounsaturated fats, which are thought to help the heart, says study researcher Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nWhich fats did have an effect? Trans fats, known to raise bad cholesterol and lower good cholesterol, were linked with a higher risk of heart disease, as expected. Omega-3s from food helped. Omega-6s appeared to help.\n\nWhat do the researchers say about the findings?\n\nNutritional guidelines on fats and heart health by such organizations as the American Heart Association may deserve another look, the study authors say.\n\nThe focus should move beyond just the fat content of food, Mozaffarian says. \"We can't judge the healthfulness of a food [only] by how many grams of saturated fat it has. We really should be moving toward a food-based analysis.\n\n\"It's not just the fat grams, and the type of food, but the way the food is processed,\" he says. For instance, the analysis found that a type of saturated fat linked with milk and dairy products reduced heart disease risk.\n\nBased on the analysis, Mozaffarian and his colleagues say, the current heart health guidelines that promote eating more foods with omega-3s and omega-6s and less of those with saturated fats are not needed.\n\nWhat do others say?\n\nOther experts find fault with the study and its conclusions.\n\n\"Mainly I think the findings should be disregarded,\" says Walter Willett, MD, chair of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. While the analysis suggests that ''saturated fat is not quite as bad as its reputation, it depends on what you compare it to,\" he says.\n\n\"If you replace saturated fat with carbohydrates or refined starch or sugar, you are not changing your heart disease risk,\" he says. ''If you replace saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat, you do get a reduction in heart disease risk.\"\n\nOne analysis is not enough to change dietary advice, says James Blankenship, MD, director of cardiology at Geisinger Medical Center.\n\nIn the analysis, the researchers themselves cite a number of caveats and limitations, such as study participants self-reporting their fat intake.\n\nIn response to the study, the American Heart Association says its guidelines remain the same. For heart health, it recommends a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, nuts, and unsaturated fats.\n\nLess than 6% of the diet should include saturated and trans fats, the association says.\n\nIs there some common ground about how to protect heart health?\n\nYes.\n\nJudging how heart-healthy a food is must take more than fat into account, Mozaffarian says. For instance, a lower-fat meat that is processed is not heart-healthy, he says.\n\nWillett agrees. \"It's important to look at single nutrients, but also at whole food groups,\" he says. Blankenship offers these steps proven to benefit the heart:\n\nGet regular exercise -- at least a half-hour a day.\nMaintain a healthy body weight.\nSee your doctor and find out your heart disease risk. Know your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\n\"Don't spend so much time looking at food labels,\" Blankenship says. Instead, he says, go to the grocery store's produce department and load up.\n\nIf cholesterol and saturated fat don't play as large a role as we thought in heart disease, what's behind the heart disease problem?\n\nMultiple factors, Blankenship says. They include obesity, genetics, sedentary lifestyles, diabetes, and high blood pressure. A poor diet drives risk, he says, \"but it's not the only thing.\"\n\nMozaffarian reports receiving fees from Bunge, Pollock Institute, Quaker Oats, Life Sciences Research Organization, Foodminds, Nutrition Impact, Amarin, Astra Zeneca, Winston and Strawn LLP, and UpToDate, and serving on the scientific advisory board for Unilever North America.\n\nThe study was funded by the British Heart Foundation, the Medical Research Council, Cambridge National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, and Gates Cambridge.","Poor old saturated fat. For over forty years now, it\u2019s been spoken of only in hushed tones, dissed as nothing but artery clogging, obesity-causing poison. This \u201ccommon sense fact\u201d has become so widely accepted that a lot of people who want to improve their diet start by purchasing skim milk, ditching their egg yolks, and beginning a life free of steak, pork, and butter.\n\nIt\u2019s time to bring bacon back to breakfast. After all, saturated fat is good for you.\n\nWe\u2019ve Made a Huge Mistake\n\nBut we all make mistakes. This one started in 1970, with the first publication of \u201cThe Seven Countries Study .\u201d The research looked at the incidences of saturated fat intake and heart disease among 12,763 men from (you guessed it) seven different countries, and showed a correlation between the two.\n\nUnfortunately, the study was deeply flawed: It didn\u2019t take into account important factors like smoking rates, sugar consumption, and exercise levels, and it left out an awful lot of data from other countries that contradicted the conclusions. The study\u2019s authors actually had access to twenty-two countries\u2019 data, and didn\u2019t discuss any of the populations that followed diets with plenty of saturated fat and barely experienced any heart disease. Such communities include the Kenyan Masai, the Tokelau in Polynesia, and the Arctic Inuit.\n\nGovernments followed by making the supposed saturated fat-heart disease connection a matter of public health policy, an ideology which probably culminated with the abominable food pyramid of the 1990s \u2014 which recommended up to 11 servings of rice and pasta per day, and about as little fat as possible.\n\nThe result? In the past 30 years in the United States, the amount of calories from consumed fat has fallen from 40 percent to 30 percent, while obesity has doubled and heart disease has remained the country\u2019s number one killer.\n\nBut the spread of obesity has no single cause; there are a lot of complicated factors that have led to America\u2019s health crisis. To figure out whether saturated fat should be added back into our diets, let\u2019s take a closer look at its effect on the body.\n\nWhy Saturated Fat Doesn't Cause Heart Disease\n\nIn a 2010 evaluation of 21 studies and 350,000 subjects, saturated fat was not associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease \u2014 and numerous other studies have reached similar conclusions        . Of course, these studies aren\u2019t without controversy. For instance, Greatist expert and physician Dr. James Hardeman believes those 21 studies aren\u2019t comprehensive enough; on average, their subjects were studied for around 14 years, which may not be long enough to see the effects of a diet high in saturated fat. However, they raise important questions about saturated fat\u2019s effects on the arteries of the heart and brain.\n\n\nPIN IT\nBut what about cholesterol? We actually have two kinds of cholesterol in our blood: the HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) and LDL (\u201cbad\u201d). Total cholesterol levels are less important than the ratio of HDL to LDL, but a simpler (if kind of flawed) approach is that we should try to increase HDL and decrease LDL. Saturated fat is generally believed to increase the bad cholesterol.\n\nBut that\u2019s only part of the story, because there are also two kinds of LDL cholesterol: big, floaty particles (type A) and small, dense ones (type B). When someone reduces their consumption of saturated fat and their LDL cholesterol \u201cdrops,\u201d they\u2019re only lowering their type A particles. But it\u2019s the type B particles that are more closely linked in heart disease, and they\u2019re generally controlled by carbohydrate consumption . So the best way to cut out harmful types of cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease could be to follow a diet that\u2019s low in carbs, rather than fat        .\n\nWhy Saturated Fat Can Be Good For You\n\nSaturated fat has been shown to have loads of positive effects on the body, including:\n\nLiver Health: Saturated fat encourages the liver cells to dump their fat cells, which helps the liver to function more effectively  .\nImmunity: Saturated fatty acids, especially the kinds found in butter and coconut, help white blood cells to recognize and destroy invading viruses and bacteria. Go get \u2018em, boys!\nHormones: Eating saturated fat tends to increase free testosterone levels, which helps to repair tissue, preserve muscle, and improve sexual function  .\nNow, fat is high in calories, so it can promote weight gain in that respect. Per gram, it has more than twice the calories of protein or carbohydrates. But provided an eye is kept on portion size, saturated fat in and of itself doesn\u2019t have any negative impact on the body. In fact, increasing fat intake might help with weight loss: One study found that when three groups of obese people were fed diets of 90 percent fat, 90 percent protein, and 90 percent carbohydrates, respectively, the high-fat group lost the most weight . Plus, it tastes freaking delicious.\n\nDROP THAT HOT DOG!\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean every source of saturated fat is healthy. Case in point: A study from the Harvard School of Public Health found that after analyzing the diets of 1.2 million people, there was no association between eating red meat and heart disease \u2014 but there was for those who ate a lot of processed meat . That is to say, if we\u2019re going to get sick from eating meat or saturated fat, it\u2019ll be by getting it from a crappy source.\n\nBasically, we should spend a little more on food. The body loves saturated fat, but from sources like grass-fed meat and butter, whole eggs, and coconut fat \u2014 not hot dogs and pepperoni pizza (sorry). By a mile, the biggest enemy in our food is likely refined sugar . Even the American Heart Association, which is still anti-saturated fat, agrees that sugar is a far bigger contributor to heart disease.\n\nBut the tide is very slowly starting to turn. Prominent journals and scientists are beginning to speak out on saturated fat\u2019s benefits, and, after government scientists reviewed 16,000 studies on diet and obesity, Sweden recently became the first Western country to advocate a high-fat diet to its citizens.\n\nThat\u2019s because heart disease and obesity are caused by inactivity, trans fats, refined carbs, and overeating, to name a few \u2014 but not saturated fat. Toss the margarine and tuck into some buttered vegetables or a seared steak. We think you deserve it.","Saturated fat has been a controversial subject in recent years, with some research suggesting that it may not be as bad for health as once thought. But a new study published in The BMJ dashes any hope that butter is actually back.\n\nCutting down on saturated fatty acids\u2014found in animal foods, like dairy and meat, as well as palm and coconut oil\u2014may lower risk of coronary heart disease, according to researchers. And swapping these foods for unsaturated fats (from vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, avocados, and seafood, for example), whole grains, and plant-based proteins (think lentils and edamame) seems to boost heart health even further.\n\nThe new findings are significant because saturated fat has been a source of debate: Studies have shown that saturated fatty acids can affect cholesterol, but there's hasn't been any definitive research linking them to overall heart health. A large meta-analysis published this summer, for example, found that butter consumption does not appear to raise heart disease risk.\n\nThe current U.S. Dietary Guidelines have taken a conservative approach to saturated fats, saying they should make up no more than 10% of total calories. Qi Sun, MD, assistant professor of nutrition in the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and senior author of the new study, says his group\u2019s findings back up this advice.\n\nRELATED: 13 Healthy High-Fat Foods You Should Eat\n\nThe new study also bolsters government recommendations for \u201ceating an overall healthful diet,\" Dr. Sun told Health\u2014one that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, vegetable cooking oils rich in polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats (the two main types of unsaturated fats), nuts, legumes, fish, and low-fat dairy.\n\nTo determine saturated fat\u2019s long-term effects on heart health, he and his colleagues followed more than 73,000 women and 42,000 men for an average of 26 years, collecting data on their diet and health every four years.\n\nAfter controlling for factors such as age, ethnicity, and other potential influencers, the researchers found that participants who consumed the most calories from four commonly consumed saturated fatty acids\u2014lauric acid, myristic acid, plametic acid, and stearic acid\u2014were 18% more likely to develop coronary heart disease over the course of the study than those who consumed the least.\n\nSome researchers have suggested putting individual limits on each of these fatty acids, said co-author Frank Hu, PhD, professor of nutrition and epidemiology, in a press release. But that\u2019s not practical, he argues, since they share many of the same food sources: red meat, dairy fat, butter, lard, and palm oil.\n\nRELATED: Good Fats, Bat Fats: How to Choose\n\nInstead, it is healthier to focus on lowering total saturated fat intake, says Hu. In fact, the researchers estimated that replacing just 1% of those fats with the same number of calories from poly- or monounsaturated fats (think avocado and nuts), whole grains, or plant-based proteins could reduce heart disease risk by 4% to 8%.\n\nThe study specifically recommends swapping animal fats (butter and lard) with vegetable oils high in unsaturated fat; and points out that restaurant food, and snacks and bakery items\u2014including crackers, chips, popcorn, cakes, and cookies\u2014can be high in saturated fat.\n\nThe researchers also offer some insight as to why prior studies haven't always shown a clear link between less saturated fat intake and better heart health. Often, the authors say, people who cut back on saturated fat replace those calories with low-quality carbs, like processed food and refined flour. These are associated with health risks of their own, and likely cancel out any health benefits.\n\nRELATED: The 22 Worst Foods for Trans Fat\n\nThis is the largest observational study to-date to examine the association between specific saturated fatty acids and the risk of coronary heart disease, say the authors, and its results are in line with previous research that has focused specifically on healthy swaps.\n\nWhile the findings aren\u2019t terribly surprising, they do serve one important purpose: As Hu put it, \u201cthis study dispels the notion that \u2018butter is back.'\"","A workout so intense that it worries some professionals is set to become the fitness trend of 2014. High intensity training (HIT) used to be the preserve of the most dedicated fitness fanatics but is heading into the mainstream, with one of the UK's largest gym companies capitalising on its popularity.\n\nFitness First is launching Tabata classes containing a four-minute form of HIT in 50 of its London gyms this month before rolling out the classes nationwide to its 180,000 members in the new year.\n\nThe chain claims the Tabata method has been \"scientifically proven to be the most effective way to increase both aerobic and anaerobic fitness\". Its website cites tests using the system which it says increased VO2 max \u2013 the maximum rate of oxygen consumption during exercise \u2013 by 13% in six weeks. It says a trial using 30-second \"bursts of intensity\" with two-minute rest periods was not as effective.\n\nJapanese scientist Professor Izumi Tabata gave his name to the method while working with his country's Olympic speed-skating team. His routine consisted of a combination of 20 seconds of intense exercise, followed by 10 seconds of rest to a rotation lasting four minutes.\n\nFitness First's website states: \"Professor Tabata's latest research shows that if [his regime] is followed correctly, the body will continue to consume more calories for up to 12 hours after the exercise class. These are additional calories to those consumed by the body at rest \u2013 so over and above the so-called RMB or Resting Metabolic Rate.\"\n\nThe dangers of HIT training, especially for people who are middle-aged, was highlighted this year when Andrew Marr said that the stroke which almost killed him occurred in the middle of an intense workout on his rowing machine at home.\n\nFitness First's online promotion does include an advisory note for anyone considering the Tabata class to consult a doctor before beginning the routines, especially if they have existing medical conditions. A spokesman said the 10-minute warm-up followed by a four-minute Tabata rotation \"will reap the same benefits as an hour on an exercise bike cycling at moderate rate\".\n\nCardiologist and fitness enthusiast Dr Aseem Malhotra questioned if HIT is the best form of exercise. \"Although I don't object in principle to high intensity training, there is no long-term data into its benefits. People exercise for all different reasons,\" he said. \"Some like to push their body to the limits, others do it competitively, but for the majority it's for improving overall health. No one can doubt the multitude of benefits of regular exercise, and as a regular gym enthusiast myself I know of the benefits as much as anyone. But, like anything, too much exercise can be a bad thing, with good data revealing that the greatest cardiovascular benefit for running was up to 20 miles a week at a moderate pace. If you ran more than this at a faster pace the benefits started to get lost.\"\n\nA study of up to 10,000 former Olympic athletes published in the British Medical Journal revealed that in disciplines with high-intensity activity, such as cycling, boxing and rowing, competitors did not live longer than those at low-intensity sports such as cricket and golf. \"In fact, those athletes who engaged in high intensity physical contact sports had a higher mortality than those in the lowest intensity,\" said Malhotra. \"For the majority of the population, improving longevity and general health can be done by brisk walking for 20 minutes three times a week \u2013 and doesn't involve spending money joining a gym.\"\n\nHIT's surge in popularity was highlighted by a recent survey of almost 30,000 people for the American College of Sports Medicine, which showed that, although once the workout of choice for twenty and thirtysomethings, older people and non-fitness enthusiasts planned to attempt the regime in 2014. Last year HIT did not appear in the top 20 of the ACSM's annual list predicting fitness trends, but this year it is number one.Professor Walt Thompson from the University of Georgia and lead author of the ACSM report said: \"We've never seen something introduced to the market and catch on so fast.\"","It is hailed as the best way to get fit, with celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Katie Holmes purporting to be fans.\n\nHigh intensity training - or HIIT as it is known -  is a form of strength training that involves the repetition of short bursts of activity or weight training.\n\nBut, if a person isn\u2019t accustomed to this form of exercise, the workouts could be doing more harm than good, experts have warned.\n\nThey revealed exhausting high intensity training can increase a person\u2019s risk of heart disease and cancer.\n\nThese work-outs also weaken the body\u2019s ability to fight off free radicals \u2013 which are the harmful chemicals that alter DNA and can lead to a host of illnesses.\n\nScientists revealed exhausting high-intensity short-burst training does more harm than good when attempted by people who are new to going to the gym +2\nScientists revealed exhausting high-intensity short-burst training does more harm than good when attempted by people who are new to going to the gym\n\nStudy author Dr Robert Boushel, of the University of British Columbia, in Canada, said: \u2018If you\u2019re new to going to the gym, participating in high-intensity \u201csprint\u201d classes may increase your performance but might not be healthy for you.\u2019\n\nHigh intensity workouts are said to be able to burn up to 1,000 calories in an hour.","Vanilla exercise is pass\u00e9. Fitness fan-atics are putting some Shades of Grey into their workouts, opting for short, sharp, punishing regimes that promise to get you twice as fit in half the time of a regular gym session. HIIT (high-intensity interval training) sessions can last for just 20 minutes. Spend 30 seconds pushing your body and metabolism out of its comfort zone by working out as hard as you can \u2014 say, by sprinting \u2014 then recover with lighter exercise, such as jogging, for 20 seconds before powering up again. And again and again.\n\nStudies have shown that within months, even weeks, the body\u2019s systems can adapt positively to the increases in stress and as a result fitness improves enormously. Research suggests that these regimes can help to reduce blood sugar levels and offset Type 2 diabetes, as well as improving strength, endurance and muscle tone. So no more excuses for those previously claiming to be \u2018too busy\u2019 to work out.\n\nAnd yet, despite the evidence, controversy is now clouding this intense exercise phenomenon. With the BBC presenter Andrew Marr\u2019s revelation that he believes his recent stroke was linked to intense interval training on a rowing machine, there is a fear that HIIT can cause more harm than good, because what all variations of these workouts share (some focus on strength, others on cardio) is that they are punishing to the extreme. So you have to be reasonably fit to begin with in order to try them safely. This, say experts, is where some people are going wrong. \u2018These types of sessions are not suitable for everyone,\u2019 says Greg Whyte, professor of applied sport and exercise science at Liverpool John Moores University. \u2018You need to have a good fitness background before you even take part. Pushing yourself to those limits is strongly inadvisable if you are in any way unfit or have underlying problems.\u2019\n\nPeople mistakenly think that because they last for just a few minutes, these workouts are an easy option. Don\u2019t be fooled. Steve Barrett, a personal trainer who has worked with leading athletes, says, \u2018They should leave you feeling as if you literally couldn\u2019t do anything more.\u2019 And that degree of effort, says Dr Dominic Micklewright, director of the sport, performance and fatigue research unit at the University of Essex, can mean \u2018there is almost certainly an increased risk of injury among untrained people with this sort of approach\u2019. Couple intense workouts with minimal calorie intake or fasting and you could find yourself suffering more for your fitness than you imagined; with blood sugar levels too low to sustain you through these workouts, headaches, muscle weakness and nausea or feeling faint could result.\n\nNone of this means that, as long as you are fit enough, the high-intensity approach should be avoided. Barrett uses it with some of his fitter clients and says it should be employed two to four times a week, in addition to run-of-the-mill activities such as steady running, cycling or swimming. And most experts agree that, if you build up to it, interval training of some sort is essential for fitness progression, but that a watered-down version of HIIT is more appropriate for the masses. Exercise scientists at McMaster University in Canada recently tried a \u2018gentler\u2019 version of a HIIT schedule, involving a minute of effort followed by a minute of easy recovery repeated ten times over 20 minutes, on a group including some previously unfit volunteers. All displayed remarkable improvements in overall health and fitness after several weeks. \u2018With any exercise, the key thing is to feel like you\u2019ve worked hard, but not to the point that you are in extreme physical discomfort or pain,\u2019 says Barrett. \u2018You do need to push yourself harder in order to progress, but it should be effort that is just within the realms of your ability. Always listen to your body.\u2019","Many people with chronic health problems resign themselves to lives of modest activity or no activity at all, thinking vigorous exercise is unsafe or that they lack the stamina for it. But recent studies are proving just the opposite.\n\nThey are showing that high-intensity exercise may be even better than regular aerobic activities for many patients with conditions like heart disease, diabetes, stroke, pulmonary disease, arthritis and Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nThe studies strongly suggest that a more demanding but more efficient and often more enjoyable form of exercise known as high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, is not only safe for most patients but more effective at preventing or reversing the deficits associated with many chronic ailments.\n\nAlthough once reserved for athletes seeking a competitive advantage and for healthy people wanting to burn more body fat, HIIT is now being studied as a treatment that is sometimes as effective as medication for many people with chronic health problems.\n\nResearchers have found that repeatedly pushing the body close to its exercise limits for very brief periods, interspersed with periods of rest, is more effective than continuous moderate activity at improving cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic and mechanical functions.\n\nInstead of continuous movement for 20 or more minutes, as is typical for exercise walkers, joggers and cyclists, HIIT usually involves 30 to 60 seconds of exercise near the peak of a person\u2019s ability, followed by a comparable recovery period of easy activity, with the sequence repeated for a total of about 20 minutes three times a week.\n\n\u201cWe know that exercise is good for people at risk of chronic disease, but people tend not to exercise,\u201d said Jonathan P. Little, a specialist in exercise physiology at the University of British Columbia at Okanagan. Yet he and other researchers report that study participants find interval training more enjoyable than continuous aerobic exercise, making it more likely that people will continue it on their own.\n\nVarious activities can be adapted to interval training, including cycling, swimming, walking and jogging, especially on a machine like a stationary bike or treadmill. But HIIT is possible indoors and out, for example by alternating sprints with more moderate exercise.\n\nThe intensity is tailored to an individual\u2019s starting ability. \u201cThe high-intensity component is set at 80 to 90 percent of the person\u2019s maximum aerobic capacity,\u201d Dr. Little said. Researchers commonly use exercise bikes and treadmills to adjust the pace mechanically.\n\nHowever, high-intensity exercise, even just half a minute at a time, is not appropriate for everyone. In a recent report in the American College of Sports Medicine\u2019s Health &amp; Fitness Journal, Dr. Little; his wife, Mary E. Jung, also at the University of British Columbia; and Marcus W. Kilpatrick of the University of South Florida wrote that HIIT \u201cis only appropriate for low-risk individuals, moderate-risk individuals who have been cleared for vigorous intensities by a medical professional, and high-risk individuals who are under direct medical supervision during exercise training.\u201d\n\nAmong the physiological benefits of HIIT are the body\u2019s increased ability to use oxygen and insulin, as well as arteries that are more elastic than continuous moderate exercise can achieve.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen, for example, that interval training is remarkably effective at lowering glucose levels in people with diabetes,\u201d Dr. Little said in an interview. \u201cJust one session improves a person\u2019s glucose level.\u201d\n\nA 12-week controlled study in Denmark of high-intensity interval walking for patients with Type 2 diabetes showed it helped control blood glucose levels better than continuous moderate exercise, even though the same number of calories was expended by both groups. Interval training also was more effective at enhancing the patients\u2019 physical fitness and reducing body fat relative to lean muscle tissue.\n\nBy making blood vessels better able to expand, HIIT can improve the cardiovascular system\u2019s ability to respond to added exertion. Oxygen-carrying blood can flow more smoothly through arteries that are wide open, which also reduces the risk of a vessel-blocking clot.\n\nThe body\u2019s ability to use oxygen efficiently improves markedly \u201cafter as little as two weeks of training\u201d with HIIT, the researchers wrote. Peak oxygen uptake \u2014 the amount of oxygen an individual can use during intense exercise \u2014 is considered the best indicator of cardiovascular fitness and an independent predictor of illness and death in cardiac patients.\n\n\u201cToo many people think incorrectly that high-intensity exercise is only for athletes, that it\u2019s a heart attack waiting to happen,\u201d Dr. Little said. On the contrary, the research strongly suggests, it is more likely to reduce the risk of a heart attack.\n\nIn a 2012 report reviewing the effects of HIIT in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure, researchers in Canada, France and Switzerland wrote that \u201cHIIT appears safe and better tolerated by patients than moderate-intensity continuous exercise\u201d and more effective at increasing patients\u2019 peak oxygen uptake, blood vessel flexibility and pumping ability of the heart.\n\nPatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are often unable to exercise long enough to gain needed health benefits. But they can do HIIT for long periods with less shortness of breath and leg discomfort, researchers at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens have reported.\n\nStroke patients with persistent disabilities can also benefit from HIIT. As rehabilitation specialists at the University of Cincinnati wrote this month in BioPortfolio, stroke patients with residual weakness \u201center a vicious cycle of limited activity and deconditioning.\u201d But while regular aerobic exercise can improve their function and cardiovascular health, preliminary studies, including one in Trondheim, Norway, suggest that patients do even better with HIIT. The Norwegian team reported that the improvements persisted for months after the six-week high-intensity exercise program ended.\n\nAnd Polish researchers demonstrated that HIIT could alleviate the rigidity and excessive muscle tone that makes it difficult for Parkinson\u2019s disease patients to move their arms and legs. The researchers, from the University School of Physical Education in Krakow, Poland, showed in 11 patients with mild to moderate Parkinson\u2019s symptoms that eight weeks of HIIT, three times a week, on a stationary bike had a global benefit, improving both lower and upper body function.\n\nReductions in rigidity and stiffness correlated with an increase in a substance called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which the researchers suggested could have stimulated the growth and function of nerves normally influenced by dopamine, the neurotransmitter that declines in Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\n","President Trump has told multiple people, including EPA head Scott Pruitt, that he intends to pull the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change, according to a new Axios report based on information from three anonymous sources with direct knowledge of the conversations. Earlier Saturday, Trump announced on Twitter that he would make a decision on the accord next week. Over the past three days, European leaders and even Pope Francis have lobbied Trump to support the agreement, but while leaders from the six other nations in the G7 signed a statement reaffirming their commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions on Saturday, Trump abstained. \u201cThe entire discussion about climate was very difficult, if not to say very unsatisfying,\u201d announced German chancellor Angela Merkel, clearly frustrated with Trump\u2019s indecision during the talks.\n\nAxios adds that it\u2019s possible Trump will impulsively change his mind, as Trump has done after telling people he would do something in the past; Axios also points out that all of Trump\u2019s options for withdrawing from the deal would require as much as a year to carry through on, allowing for some additional uncertainty.\n\nSpeaking of uncertainty, in a Face the Nation interview set to air on CBS Sunday, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said that he was \u201cquite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord.\u201d Speaking with the New York Times, Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, also made it sound as if Trump was still making up his mind after \u201ca lot of give-and-take between the different countries\u201d at the G7 summit. But according to Axios\u2019s sources, Trump has already made his decision to ditch the pact, and that would definitely be consistent with his numerous past statements as one of the world\u2019s most notorious deniers of the consensus scientific conclusion that human activity is the primary driver of global climate change. He also said during his presidential campaign that he would cancel the deal and has infamously and repeatedly called global warming a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese (and scientists) \u2014 but Trump says a lot of things and has, at least a few times, also hinted that he understood the threat of climate change.\n\nPresident Obama helped negotiate the historic Paris Agreement in 2015, and it was officially ratified by the U.S. and 194 other signatories last year. Should Trump leave the pact, the U.S. would be the first country to exit, which would also be the second time that America has signed onto a global climate deal under a Democratic president only to walk away from the same agreement under a Republican predecessor, as President George W. Bush ultimately reneged on the Kyoto Protocol agreed to by President Bill Clinton in 1997.\n\nAmerica\u2019s exit from the Paris Agreement wouldn\u2019t invalidate the accord, which still has the support of most of the world, including China, and is likely to proceed without U.S. participation. But the failure of the U.S. to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions, being the world\u2019s second-highest producer of such pollution, will worsen and likely accelerate an already dangerous problem. If other countries follow the U.S. out of the agreement, which remains a risk, that danger only multiplies.","President Trump has privately told multiple people, including EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, that he plans to leave the Paris agreement on climate change, according to three sources with direct knowledge.\n\nPublicly, Trump's position is that he has not made up his mind and when we asked the White House about these private comments, Director of Strategic Communications Hope Hicks said, \"I think his tweet was clear. He will make a decision this week.\"\n\nWhy this matters: Pulling out of Paris is the biggest thing Trump could to do unravel Obama's climate policies. It also sends a stark and combative signal to the rest of the world that working with other nations on climate change isn't a priority to the Trump administration. And pulling out threatens to unravel the ambition of the entire deal, given how integral former President Obama was in making it come together in the first place.\n\nCaveat: Although Trump made it clear during the campaign and in multiple conversations before his overseas trip that he favored withdrawal, he has been known to abruptly change his mind \u2014 and often floats notions to gauge the reaction of friends and aides. On the trip, he spent many hours with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, powerful advisers who back the deal.\n\nBehind-the-scenes: The mood inside the EPA this week has been one of nervous optimism. In a senior staff meeting earlier this week, Pruitt told aides he wanted them to pump the brakes on publicly lobbying for withdrawal from Paris.\n\nInstead, the EPA staff are quietly working with outside supporters to place op eds favoring withdrawal from Paris.\nThe White House has told Pruitt to lay off doing TV appearances until Trump announces his decision on Paris. (In past weeks, the EPA Administrator has gone on TV to say the U.S. needs to quit Paris, but Pruitt told aides he'll be keeping a lower profile. He doesn't want a Paris withdrawal to be seen as his victory. \"It needs to be the President's victory,\" one source said, paraphrasing what Pruitt has told aides.)\nPruitt's aides have told associates in recent days that they remain confident the President will withdraw from Paris but they've been worried about him being overseas and exposed to pressure from European leaders and the environmentalist views of his top aides like Ivanka and economic adviser Gary Cohn. Top EPA staff were relieved when Trump refused to join the other six nations of the G7 in reaffirming \"strong commitment\" to the Paris agreement.\nOne level deeper: If Trump follows through and announces publicly he plans to withdraw from the Paris deal, an administration official laid out three ways he could do that:\n\nTrump could announce he is pulling the U.S. from the deal, which would trigger a withdrawal process that wouldn't conclude until November 2020 at the earliest. Under the deal's terms, any country can't send notice of its intent to withdraw until three years after the deal entered into force, which was Nov. 4, 2016. The actual process of withdrawal would then take one year. In this time, it's feasible Trump could change his mind, the administration source said.\nTrump could declare that the Paris deal is actually a legal treaty that requires Senate approval. Such a vote would fail, and then Trump would have Senate backing to not abide by the deal, which he deems a treaty. A letter that 22 Senate Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, sent to Trump this week urging him to withdraw from the deal, increases the odds of this happening, the source said. Trump could also call for a Senate vote in combination with either the first or third option.\nTrump could withdraw the U.S. from the treaty that underpins the Paris deal, which is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This would be the most extreme option because it would take the U.S. out of all global climate diplomacy. This process would take just one year.\nWill we always have Paris? All of these scenarios take more time and maneuvering than a simple announcement, which ensures the debate about what to do with the climate deal won't be over with any time soon.","Donald Trump\u2019s intentions regarding US participation in the Paris climate deal remained unknown on Sunday, as one report cited \u201cconfidants\u201d saying the president had made up his mind to pull out while a senior cabinet figure said he was \u201cquite certain the president is wide open on this issue\u201d.\n\nTrump said in a tweet on Saturday: \u201cI will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!\u201d\n\nThe message was published as Trump left Sicily after the G7 summit. Leaders of the other G7 nations \u2013 Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Japan \u2013 issued a communique confirming their support for the climate deal, which was reached with contributions from Barack Obama in 2015 and signed the following year.\n\nA report from the Axios news outlet, however, cited \u201cthree sources with direct knowledge\u201d as saying Trump had told confidants including the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, that he plannned to pull the US out of the deal.\n\nIn an interview broadcast on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, meanwhile, defense secretary James Mattis said the White House had \u201cobviously got a discussion going on about our policy in this regard\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd I was sitting in on some of the discussions in Brussels, by the way, where climate change came up, and the president was open, he was curious about why others were in the position they were in \u2026 and I\u2019m quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord.\u201d\n\nMattis said that as defense secretary, such negotiations were \u201cnot inside my portfolio\u201d, but added: \u201cObviously we deal with the aspects of a warming climate in the Department of Defense, and to us, that\u2019s just another one of the many factors we deal with which we call the physical environment.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to media requests for comment. On Sunday morning, however, the president offered comment of his own, via Twitter, that might have been aimed at the anonymous sources cited in the Axios report.\n\n\u201cIt is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cWhenever you see the words \u2018sources say\u2019 in the fake news media, and they don\u2019t mention names it is very possible that those sources don\u2019t exsist [sic] but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy!\u201d\n","Jonathan Swain and Amy Harder at Axios reported on Sunday morning that President Donald Trump has told \"confidants\" that he has made the decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Accords, and will make an announcement soon, most likely this coming week.  This report will certainly produce a major backlash from the anti-fossil fuel lobby in the U.S. and globally, which correctly views the commitments made by former President Barack Obama under this executive agreement as the main driving force for increasingly restrictive regulations of the U.S. fossil fuel industries.\n\nBut this report, if true, should surprise no one after the President was the only G7 leader who refrained from endorsing the Paris Accords on Saturday, a move that came after one of his advisers had told the media that Mr. Trump's views related to Paris were \"evolving.\"  This statement was taken by many Paris supporters as an indication that the President might be moving towards changing his mind and keeping the U.S. in the agreement after all.\n\nSuch hope by Paris supporters has always seemed like a pipe dream, though, since the Obama commitments within the Paris accord stand in direct opposition to the commitments made by candidate Trump during the 2016 campaign, as well as the energy policy-related actions taken by President Trump since assuming office.\n\nDuring his campaign, Candidate Trump made pledges to pull the U.S. out of two Obama-era executive agreements - Paris and Iran - centerpieces of his daily stump speech.  At every campaign stop, every fundraising event, every one of the campaign rallies before audiences of thousands of people, Donald Trump overtly promised to end U.S. involvement in both of those agreements, which he regularly referred to as \"terrible deals\" made by \"stupid\" people.  Indeed, this was the overarching theme of his entire campaign - that he is a superior negotiator who would be able to negotiate better deals than these for the country.\n\nAny expectation that he would now, after being pressured by his European peers, suddenly decide that Paris is a fine \"deal\" that the U.S. can now live under seems overly optimistic, to say the least.  It would comparable to Sherlock Holmes, after years of demonizing Dr. Moriarty as the worst villain on the face of the earth, suddenly deciding he's a really cool guy with whom he'd love to have a few beers.\n\nRecommended by Forbes\nMOST POPULAR Photos: The Richest Person In Every State\nCongratulations To Venezuela - Goldman Sachs Bails Out The Country By Buying...\nThen there is the reality that, as President, Mr. Trump has already issued a series of executive orders and signed Congressional Review Act resolutions that either reverse outright or order the EPA and Department of Interior (DOI) to rescind or rewrite a raft of Obama-era regulations and executive decisions for which the commitments in the Paris Accords serve as the main underpinnings.\n\nThe Clean Power Plan, the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) venting and flaring regulation, EPA's methane regulations and stricter ozone standard, higher gas mileage requirements for auto makers, the Council of Environmental Quality's (CEQ) \"social cost of carbon and methane\" construct, the presidential directive to all agencies to consider climate change implications in all permitting, planning and leasing decisions - all of these Obama-era actions and more were considered to be key elements of U.S. efforts to meet commitments Mr. Obama made under the Paris agreement.  All of these elements have either been eliminated or are in the process of being re-written under directives issued by President Trump.","President Donald Trump has reportedly told multiple people in private that he will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement.\n\nThough Trump has publicly said he has not yet made up his mind, Axios reports he has privately told several people of his decision, including EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.\n\nThe outlet spoke with three sources who confirmed the information, though Trump has been known to change his mind at the last minute.\n\nTrump tweeted Saturday morning to say he would announce his 'final decision' on whether or not the US will stay in the Paris agreement next week despite coming under intense pressure from world leaders at the G7 in Sicily.\n\n'I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!' he wrote.\n\nThe president earlier declined to comment about the accord, as he refused to give into intense international pressure.\n\nWithin the Environmental Protection Agency, staffers are quieting down on public lobbying and Pruitt will have fewer television appearances about the issue so that the withdrawal will be 'the President's victory', according to Axios.\n\nThere are also concerns within the EPA that Trump could be influenced by the pressures he received overseas, according to the outlet. Earlier Saturday, the other members of the G7 voted to abide by the Paris climate agreement, according to a person familiar with the talks. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter before the formal announcement.\n\nThe leaders attempted to convince Trump for three days - first in Brussels at meetings of NATO and the European Union, then in Sicily for G7, but the former reality television host left Italy without making clear where he stands.\n\nUnder the G7 agreement, the Trump administration will be given more time to consider whether it will remain committed to the 2015 Paris deal to rein in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBacking out of the climate accord had been a central plank of Trump's campaign and aides have been exploring whether they can adjust the framework of the deal even if they do not opt out entirely.","President-elect Donald J. Trump has not been inaugurated yet, but he's already backtracking on some of his most high-profile campaign positions.\n\nThe latest walk-back concerns global climate change: specificallys the agreement that world leaders recently put in place to rein in emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday with senior reporters and editors of the New York Times, Trump said he has \"an open mind\" on whether to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement. \u201cI\u2019m looking at it very closely,\" he said\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump was quite clear on this. During an energy policy speech on May 26, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payment of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.\"\n\nDuring U.N. climate talks that ended this week, China emerged as the new leader on the issue if the U.S. were to stop mobilizing international support for climate action, as it has under President Obama.\n\nThe Paris Climate Agreement entered into force on Nov. 4, 2016, and sets a goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels through 2100.\n\nIt also contains an even more stringent target of 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, through 2100 in order to limit climate impacts on small island countries and other vulnerable nations.\n\nIn Trump's discussion with the Times, Trump said he is also keeping his mind open about whether global warming is mainly due to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, or other causes.\n\n\nScientists, of course, settled this matter long ago, with the debate within the climate community now focused on just how severe the consequences of human-caused climate change will be, rather than whether the phenomenon exists in the first place.\n\nThrough his personnel decisions, Trump has given every indication that he plans to gut environmental regulations and boost fossil fuel production, including coal, which is the most carbon intensive fuel source.\n\nEnvironmental groups are skeptical that Trump's statements on Tuesday represent much of a change.\n\n\"Actions speak louder than words,\" said 350.org executive director Mary Boeve in a statement. \"As long as Trump has a climate change denier like Myron Ebell running his transition team, you know this is all a bunch of empty rhetoric.\"\n\n\"... Trump is going on about fantasies like \u2018clean coal\u2019 and flip-flopping around on whether there\u2019s \u2018some connectivity\u2019 between humans and climate change. The President-elect needs to get up to speed, and fast.\u201d\n\nMichael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, pointed to Trump's shortlist for cabinet positions dealing with climate issues, such as oil tycoon Harold Hamm for Energy Secretary, as evidence there is not much of a shift taking place.\n\n\"We\u2019re waiting for action, and Trump is kidding nobody on climate as he simultaneously stacks his transition team and cabinet with climate science deniers and the dirtiest hacks the fossil fuel industry can offer,\" Brune said.\n\n\"Prove it, President-elect. The world is watching.\u201d","A proposed secret communications back channel between Donald Trump's team and the Kremlin was reportedly intended to allow sensitive discussions about strategy in Syria, it was reported last night.\n\nJared Kushner, Mr Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, was revealed to have proposed setting up the secret line in a meeting with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, at Trump Tower in December.\n\nThe back channel was intended to connect Michael Flynn, who was at the meeting and later became Mr Trump's first National Security Adviser, with Russian military leaders, the Associated Press reported. It came as the nascent Trump administration was developing its Syria policy before his inauguration. The communications would have used Russian diplomatic facilities and bypassed the US intelligence services.\n\nSuch a system was never established and after Rex Tillerson became Secretary of State the idea was reportedly dropped as Mr Trump's team decided to communicate with Moscow through more official channels.\n\nThe discussion of a back channel involving Mr Kushner was first revealed by the Washington Post late on Friday. US officials reportedly learned about it by monitoring Russian communications. Mr Kislyak was said to have been \"taken aback\" by Mr Kushner's proposal.\n\nIt also emerged Mr Kushner had at least three interactions, including two phone calls, with Mr Kislyak, during and after the election, that had not been previously disclosed. The discussions reportedly focused on fighting terrorism and improving US-Russian economic relations\n\nMr Kushner's lawyer Jamie Gorelick said: \"Mr Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings. He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry.\"\n\nShe said Mr Kushner could not remember any calls with Mr Kislyak before the election. She added: \"Mr Kushner participated in thousands of calls in this time period.\"\n\nAccording to Reuters Mr Kushner also met Sergei Nikolaevich Gorkov, the head of Russian state-owned bank Vnesheconombank and a trained intelligence officer appointed by Vladimir Purin, at Trump Tower in December. The bank is under US sanctions.\n\nThe White House declined to answer questions about Mr Kushner's meeting with Mr Kislyak.\n\nBut H.R. McMaster, who replaced Mr Flynn as National Security Adviser  said so-called \"back-channeling\" was completely normal. Asked if it would concern him if someone in the Trump administration tried to set up a back channel with the Russian embassy or the Kremlin, he replied: \"No\".\n\nHe said: \"We have back-channel communications with any number of individual countries. What that allows you to do is communicate in a discreet manner.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee which is investigating any links between the Trump campaign and Russia, asked the campaign to produce all Russia-related documents, including phone records and emails, dating back to its official start in June 2015.","Jared Kushner and Russia\u2019s ambassador to Washington discussed the possibility of setting up a secret and secure communications channel between Trump\u2019s transition team and the Kremlin, using Russian diplomatic facilities in an apparent move to shield their pre-inauguration discussions from monitoring, according to U.S. officials briefed on intelligence reports.\n\nAmbassador Sergey Kislyak reported to his superiors in Moscow that Kushner, son-in-law and confidant to then-President-elect Trump, made the proposal during a meeting on Dec. 1 or 2 at Trump Tower, according to intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U.S. officials. Kislyak said Kushner suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States for the communications.\n\nThe meeting also was attended by Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser.\n\nThe White House disclosed the meeting only in March, playing down its significance. But people familiar with the matter say the FBI now considers the encounter, as well as another meeting Kushner had with a Russian banker, to be of investigative interest.\n\nKislyak reportedly was taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate \u2014 a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well as the Trump team.\n\nNeither the meeting nor the communications of Americans involved were under U.S. surveillance, officials said.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, declined to comment. The Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRussia at times feeds false information into communication streams it suspects are monitored as a way of sowing misinformation and confusion among U.S. analysts. But officials said that it\u2019s unclear what Kislyak would have had to gain by falsely characterizing his contacts with Kushner to Moscow, particularly at a time when the Kremlin still saw the prospect of dramatically improved relations with Trump.\n\nKushner\u2019s apparent interest in establishing a secret channel with Moscow, rather than relying on U.S. government systems, has added to the intrigue surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s relationship with Russia. The FBI closely monitors the communications of Russian officials in the United States, and it maintains a nearly constant surveillance of its diplomatic facilities. The National Security Agency monitors the communications of Russian officials overseas.\n\nCurrent and former U.S. intelligence officials said that although Russian diplomats have secure means of communicating with Moscow, Kushner\u2019s apparent request for access to such channels was extraordinary.\n\n\u201cHow would he trust that the Russians wouldn\u2019t leak it on their side?\u201d said one former senior intelligence official. The FBI would know that a Trump transition official was going in and out of the embassy, which would cause \u201ca great deal\u201d of concern, he added. The entire idea, he said, \u201cseems extremely naive or absolutely crazy.\u201d\n\nThe discussion of a secret channel adds to a broader pattern of efforts by Trump\u2019s closest advisers to obscure their contacts with Russian counterparts. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, Flynn, was forced to resign after a series of false statements about his conversations with Kislyak. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from matters related to the Russia investigation after it was revealed that he had failed to disclose his own meetings with Kislyak when asked during congressional testimony about any contact with Russians.\n\nKushner\u2019s interactions with Russians \u2014 including Kislyak and an executive for a Russian bank under U.S. sanctions \u2014 were not acknowledged by the White House until they were exposed in media reports.\n\nIt is common for senior advisers of a newly elected president to be in contact with foreign leaders and officials. But new administrations are generally cautious in their handling of interactions with Moscow, which U.S. intelligence agencies have accused of waging an unprecedented campaign to interfere in last year\u2019s presidential race and help elect Trump.\n\nObama administration officials say members of the Trump transition team never approached them about arranging a secure communications channel with their Russian contacts, possibly because of concerns about leaks.\n\nThe State Department, the White House National Security Council and U.S. intelligence agencies all have the ability to set up secure communications channels with foreign leaders, though doing so for a transition team would be unusual.\n\nTrump\u2019s advisers were similarly secretive about meetings with leaders from the United Arab Emirates. The Obama White House only learned that the crown prince of Abu Dhabi was flying to New York in December to see Kushner, Flynn and Stephen K. Bannon, another top Trump adviser, because U.S. border agents in the UAE spotted the Emirate leader\u2019s name on a flight manifest.\n\nRussia would also have had reasons of its own to reject such an overture from Kushner. Doing so would require Moscow to expose its most sophisticated communications capabilities \u2014 which are likely housed in highly secure locations at diplomatic compounds \u2014 to an American.\nThe Post was first alerted in mid-December to the meeting by an anonymous letter, which said, among other things, that Kushner had talked to Kislyak about setting up the communications channel. This week, officials who reviewed the letter and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence said the portion about the secret channel was consistent with their understanding of events.\n\nFor instance, according to those officials and the letter, Kushner conveyed to the Russians that he was aware that it would be politically sensitive to meet publicly, but it was necessary for the Trump team to be able to continue their communication with Russian government officials.\n\nIn addition to their discussion about setting up the communications channel, Kushner, Flynn and Kislyak also talked about arranging a meeting between a representative of Trump and a \u201cRussian contact\u201d in a third country whose name was not identified, according to the anonymous letter.\n\nThe Post reported in April that Erik Prince, the founder of the private security firm Blackwater, now called Academi, and an informal adviser to the Trump transition team, met on Jan. 11 \u2014 nine days before Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean with a representative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.","At this point, it almost feels like the Washington Post is trolling everyone with the amount of fake news they put out.\n\nDuring the meeting wherein the Washington Post asserted that Jared Kushner proposed a secure line between the Trump administration and Russia, it was actually the Russians who proposed it, a source close to Kushner informed Fox News.\n\nThe source alleges that the permanent back channel \u201cwas never discussed\u201d. What really happened was the proposal of a one-off call about Syria.\n\nFox News reports:\n\nA December meeting between Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and one of the senior advisers in the Trump administration, and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak at Trump Tower focused on Syria, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News Monday.\n\nDuring the meeting the Russians broached the idea of using a secure line between the Trump administration and Russia, not Kushner, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News. That follows a recent report from The Washington Post alleging that Kushner wanted to develop a secure, private line with Russia.\n\nThe idea of a permanent back channel was never discussed, according to the source. Instead, only a one-off for a call about Syria was raised in the conversation.\n\nIn addition, the source told Fox News the December meeting focused on Russia\u2019s contention the Obama administration\u2019s policy on Syria was deeply flawed.\n\n. . .\n\nKushner suggested the use of Russian diplomatic facilities as a way to shield pre-inauguration discussions with Kislyak from monitoring, according to The Post.\n\nThe fake news from the Washington Post just keeps coming and yet they are never to be held accountable for some reason.\n\nYou can watch a Fox News video below wherein they discuss the fake news the Washington Post pushed:","The idea of a permanent back channel was never discussed, according to the source. Instead, only a one-off for a call about Syria was raised in the conversation.\n\nIn addition, the source told Fox News the December meeting focused on Russia's contention that the Obama administration's policy on Syria was deeply flawed.\n\nJARED KUSHNER WANTED SECRET COMMUNICATIONS CHANNEL WITH RUSSIA, NEW REPORT ALLEGES\n\nDetails of the meeting follow a NBC report that Kushner, who is married to Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, is currently under FBI scrutiny as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nKushner suggested the use of Russian diplomatic facilities as a way to shield pre-inauguration discussions with Kislyak from monitoring, according to The Post.\n\nKislyak allegedly then relayed the suggestion to his superiors in Moscow. That was based on intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U.S. officials, although neither the meeting nor the communications of the Americans involved were under U.S. surveillance, officials told the Post.\n\nThe source has told Fox News that Kushner is eager to tell Congress about the meeting and any others of interest.","President Trump's son-in-law and now top White House advisor Jared Kushner proposed a secret back channel between the Kremlin and the Trump transition team during a December meeting with a leading Russian diplomat.\n\nKushner spoke with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about creating that line of communication to facilitate sensitive discussions aimed at exploring the incoming administration's options with Russia as it was developing its Syria policy, according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke with the Associated Press.\n\nThe intent was to connect Trump's then-chief national security advisor Michael T. Flynn with Russian military leaders, said the source, who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss private policy deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nRussia, a pivotal player in Syria, has backed Syrian President Bashar Assad, often at the expense of civilians during a long civil war. The White House did not acknowledge the meeting or Kushner's attendance until March. At the time, a White House official dismissed it as a brief courtesy meeting.\n\nKushner's involvement in the proposed back channel was first reported by the Washington Post, which said he proposed using Russian diplomatic facilities for the discussions, apparently to make them more difficult to monitor.\n\nThe newspaper cited anonymous U.S. officials who were briefed on intelligence reports on intercepted Russian communications.\n\nThe Post wrote that Kislyak was reportedly taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate \u2014 a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well as the Trump team.\n\nAccording to the person familiar with the Kushner meeting, the Trump team eventually felt there was no need for a back channel once Rex Tillerson was confirmed as secretary of State, and decided to communicate with Moscow through more official channels. Tillerson was sworn in Feb. 1.\n\nFlynn served briefly as Trump's national security advisor before being fired in February after officials said he misled Vice President Mike Pence about whether he and the ambassador had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia in a phone call.\n\nSally Yates, the former acting U.S. attorney general, told Congress this month that the deception left Flynn vulnerable to being blackmailed by the Russians. Flynn remains under federal investigation in Virginia over his foreign business ties and was interviewed by the FBI in January about his contacts with Kislyak.\n\nThe disclosure of the back channel put White House advisors on the defensive Saturday, as Trump wrapped up his first foreign trip as president, and led lawyers for Kushner to say he is willing to talk with federal and congressional investigators about his foreign contacts and his work on the Trump campaign.\n\nMeeting with reporters in Sicily, two Trump advisors refused to address the contents of Kushner's December meeting with the Russian diplomat. But they did not dismiss the idea that the administration would go outside normal U.S. government and diplomatic channels for communications with other countries.\n\nSpeaking generally, national security advisor H.R. McMaster said \u201cwe have back channel communications with a number of countries.\u201d He added: \u201cIt allows you to communicate in a discreet manner.\u201d\n\nIn response to repeated questions from reporters, Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn said, \u201cWe're not going to comment on Jared. We're just not going to comment.\u201d\n\nKushner was a trusted Trump advisor last year, overseeing the campaign's digital strategy, and remains an influential confidant within the White House as does his wife, Ivanka Trump.\n\nFederal investigators and several congressional committees are looking into any connections between Russia and the Trump campaign, including allegations that there may have been collaboration to help Trump and harm his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nOn Saturday, the Associated Press confirmed that the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, has requested information and documents from Trump's campaign.","President Trump unexpectedly fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday after a finding by the Justice Department that he mishandled the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails last year.\n\nTrump said he acted based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who found that Comey improperly moved to \"usurp\" the attorney general's authority and decided not to prosecute Clinton.\n\n\"I have received the attached letters from the attorney general and deputy attorney general of the United States recommending your dismissal as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" Trump said in a letter to Comey. \"I have accepted their recommendation and you are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately.\"\n\n\"While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,\" Trump said. \"It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.\"\n\nThe Trump administration will immediately begin a search for Comey's successor. FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has been floated as a possible replacement, according to Fox News.\n\n\"The FBI is one of our nation's most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement,\" Trump said in a White House statement.\n\nIn a memo explaining to Trump why he thought Comey should be fired, Rosenstein, who was sworn into office in late April, pointed to the FBI director's July press conference explaining why Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should not be prosecuted over her use of a private email server while secretary of state.\n\n\"The director was wrong to usurp the attorney general's authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution. It is not the function of the director to make such an announcement. At most, the director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors,\" Rosenstein wrote.\n\nComey's involvement in the 2016 general election didn't end there. On Oct. 28, just days before voters went to the polls, Comey sent a letter to Congress saying new emails had surfaced related to the investigation into whether Clinton had mishandled classified information.\n\nJust over a week later, Comey said they had found no new wrongdoing by Clinton, but the candidate's staff has argued the Oct. 28 letter significantly hurt her campaign.\n\nDays after Trump's inauguration in January, Trump memorably shook Comey's hand while meeting at the White House.","Just hours after the FBI sent a letter Tuesday to the Senate Judiciary Committee clarifying his testimony in relation to the Hillary Clinton email scandal, FBI Director James Comey was fired.\n\n\"Today, President Donald J. Trump informed FBI Director James Comey that he has been terminated and removed from office,\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement. \"President Trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\"\n\nTrump's letter terminating Comey quickly leaked online.\n\n\"While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,\" Trump wrote. \"It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.\"\n\nHere are a few reasons, both stated and possible, Comey may have been canned:\n\nHe hurt the FBI's reputation\n\nA memorandum prepared by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommending Comey's termination kicks off with the fact that \"over the past year ... the FBI's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice.\"\n\nHe mishandled the Clinton email investigation\n\nRosenstein writes that Comey should not have given a news conference last July recommending that Clinton, who used a private email server while secretary of state, not face criminal charges. The deputy attorney general writes that Comey should have turned his findings over to federal prosecutors. He also takes issue with Comey's decision to send a letter just days before the November election revealing newly discovered Clinton emails. \"When federal agents and prosecutors quietly open a criminal investigation, we are not concealing anything; we are simply following the longstanding policy that we refrain from publicizing non-public information,\" the letter states.\n\nHe broke with tradition\n\nRosenstein cites several attorneys general and other authorities who decried Comey's actions as a \"departure from the department's widely respected, nonpartisan traditions.\" Rosenstein writes that \"we should reject the departure and return to the traditions.\"\n\nTrump doesn't like him\n\nSimply judging from his tweets, the president and Comey have had a rocky relationship. As Axios laid out, Trump first criticized the director online in July after that fateful, aforementioned news conference. Trump used the hashtag #RiggedSystem. By October, when he was bringing attention to a new cache of Clinton emails, Trump loved him\u2014but in November, when Comey said he hadn't actually found material that justified charges, the pendulum had swung again.\n\n\"You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days. You can't do it, folks,\" Trump said at a rally. \"Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know it.\"\n\nTrump is embarrassed by him\n\nThe president recently accused his predecessor, Barack Obama, of wiretapping his phones during the campaign. Comey has shut down this allegation, explaining that Obama could not order a wiretap of anyone's phone unchecked.\n\n\"I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI,\" Comey said in March. \"The Department of Justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the Department of Justice and all its components. The department has no information that supports those tweets.\"\n\nHe knows something about Russia\n\nOf course, the elephant in the room is the ongoing investigation into whether people associated with Trump's campaign had contact with Russia during the election. Comey confirmed the probe in March.\n\n\"We approach this work in an open-minded, independent way and our expert investigators will conclude that work as quickly as they can, but they will always do it well no matter how long that takes,\" he said, according to a transcript of his remarks. \"I can promise you, we will follow the facts wherever they lead.\"\n\nClinton's running mate, Tim Kaine, picked up on this after news of Comey's firing Tuesday, tweeting, \"Trump firing Comey shows how frightened the Admin is over Russia investigation.\"","The White House says that President Trump fired James Comey on Tuesday because he received a brief letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions calling for the FBI director\u2019s dismissal. That letter relies on a longer memo in which Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommends that Comey be dismissed over his mishandling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal during the campaign. A White House spokesman told Politico that Trump did not request the letters, and had no idea that they were coming.\n\nAs New York contributor Roger Parloff notes, this memo might have made sense if it was issued on day one of the Trump administration. \u201cBut for it to suddenly come out on May 9, 2017, after the nation has watched and listened to Trump warmly defend and commend Comey\u2019s conduct in countless tweets and interviews, renders its content simply incredible.\u201d\n\nPlus, the president\u2019s short letter to Comey says nothing about the Clinton probe, but references the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s possible Russia ties, saying, \u201cI greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.\u201d\n\nSure enough, several outlets reported early on Wednesday morning that Comey\u2019s dismissal was actually about Trump\u2019s anger over the FBI\u2019s Russia probe and Comey\u2019s media appearances. The president has reportedly been mulling the move for at least a week \u2014 and maybe much longer. It appears this moment from January 22, when Trump greeted Comey by blowing him a kiss and commenting \u201cOh, and there\u2019s James \u2014 he\u2019s become more famous than me,\u201d was a sign that Comey\u2019s days as director were numbered.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, in recent months Trump became irritated that Comey was receiving more media attention, and wasn\u2019t using his newfound fame to quash the rumors about Trump\u2019s Russia ties:\n\nThe more James Comey showed up on television discussing the FBI\u2019s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, the more the White House bristled, according to aides to President Donald Trump.\n\nFrustration was growing among top associates of the president that Mr. Comey, in a series of appearances before a Senate panel, wouldn\u2019t publicly tamp down questions about possible collusion with Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race. A person with knowledge of recent conversations said they wanted Mr. Comey to \u201csay those three little words: \u2018There\u2019s no ties.\u2019\u201d\nPolitico reports that Trump was particularly angry about Comey confirming to the Senate in March that the FBI had been investigating his campaign since last summer, and the director\u2019s refusal to back up his claim that President Obama wiretapped him. He\u2019d even taken to shouting at his TV over the Russia investigation:\n\nHe had grown enraged by the Russia investigation, two advisers said, frustrated by his inability to control the mushrooming narrative around Russia. He repeatedly asked aides why the Russia investigation wouldn\u2019t disappear and demanded they speak out for him. He would sometimes scream at television clips about the probe, one adviser said.\nOnly a handful of top advisers, including Sessions and Rosenstein, knew Trump was planning to fire Comey. According to CNN, the pair started fine-tuning their rationale for firing Comey after they learned Trump wanted him gone.\n\nIt appears those in the know seriously underestimated the ramifications of the president dismissing the official leading an investigation into his campaign. Sources told Politico that the White House thought Comey\u2019s firing would be \u201cwin-win,\u201d since he\u2019d been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans. Trump called several senators to inform them of his decision on Monday evening, and was reportedly \u201ctaken aback\u201d when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told him he was making a huge mistake.\n\nNevertheless, Trump\u2019s security aide Keith Schiller was sent to personally deliver Comey\u2019s dismissal letter to FBI headquarters. Apparently the White House was unaware that Comey was in Los Angeles on Tuesday.\n\nLike Comey himself, many top White House officials only learned what had happened from media reports. Yet Trump was reportedly annoyed that his staff was caught off guard:\n\nOne source familiar with the President\u2019s reaction to TV coverage of the Comey firing told CNN that Trump was upset because he perceived that nobody was defending him on the cable networks. So he dispatched top communications aides Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders to appear on television to defend the White House, the source said.\nWhile Trump is known to put a lot of stock in how things play on cable news, in general the White House doesn\u2019t seem all that concerned about the optics of the situation. Hours after the news broke, the White House announced that Trump will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday, and a Justice Department official suggested that there could be more firings.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of cleaning house that needs to be done,\u201d the official said.","With an unanticipated coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre, Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey yesterday (May 9). Comey learned of his dismissal from cable news reports while at an event on talent acquisition and diversity at the FBI. It was so unexpected that the former FBI director apparently thought it was a joke.\nAccording to the official version of what transpired, the Trump administration decided to fire Comey in large part because of his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. But the fact that Comey was in charge of investigating potential ties between the Trump administration and Russia seems too coincidental to overlook. Many pundits have also pointed out the parallels between Trump\u2019s decision and president Richard Nixon\u2019s notorious Saturday Night Massacre, when Nixon fired the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.\nTrump\u2019s administration has already weathered its fair share of scandals. The maelstrom of media coverage and the confusing and contradictory explanations offered by Trump aides can make it difficult to discern which stories are actually problematic and which are more smoke than fire.\nSo how big a deal is Comey\u2019s firing? To gauge this we first need to know the real reasons motivating Trump and his attorney general. With the administration sticking to its story\u2014for now\u2014here is a ranking of possible scenarios:\nTrump fired Comey because his mistakes made the FBI look bad\n\nRanking: Easy D\nOn May 8, Comey testified in front of the Senate judiciary committee. During this appearance, he said that HillaryClinton\u2019s top aide Huma Habedin had forwarded \u201chundreds and thousands\u201d of emails to her husband Anthony Weiner, some of which were classified\u2014so that Weiner could print them out. That claim turned out to be incorrect. According to the White House, it was also the last straw: Comey had mishandled the Clinton investigation since the very beginning, the administration used this last mistake as a reason to finally pull the plug on him.\nIf plain incompetence is indeed the real reason behind Comey\u2019s firing, it would represent the least concerning scenario. As Quartz has already pointed out, the decision could have been managed more elegantly and the timing is bizarre as most of Comey\u2019s alleged mistakes happened months ago. Then again, delayed firings are one of Trump\u2019s specialities.\nThe silver lining? If Trump is truly committed to investigating Russia\u2019s alleged meddling\u2014and this is a huge hypothetical if\u2014he may be more likely to appoint an independent special prosecutor to pick up Comey\u2019s investigation.\nTrump fired Comey because he wouldn\u2019t investigate wiretapping at Trump Tower\n\nRanking: Sad!\nTrump is a master conspiracy theorist, especially when it comes to the circumstances of his own election. Whether claiming Clinton benefited from millions of illegal votes or arguing with the National Parks Service over the crowd at his inauguration, Trump, by his own admission, believes the truth is not absolute.\nOne of Trump\u2019s strongly held opinions is the unproven claim that president Obama tapped his phones during the campaign. Relatedly, it\u2019s possible that when Comey refused to substantiate the conspiracy, the president grew increasingly frustrated and eventually decided to cook up an excuse to get rid of the FBI director. Comey\u2019s bungled testimony regarding the Clinton emails represented the perfect opportunity.\nA vindictive president who believes in alternative facts and doesn\u2019t like being questioned is an unpredictable president. Partisanship is bad enough\u2014presidents should not allow their personal biases to dictate policy and professional duties.\nTrump fired Comey because of the Russia investigation\n\nRanking: Total disaster!\nBut what if Trump was truly attempting to use his executive powers to halt an investigation and potentially enable a cover-up? This is the worst case scenario.\nComey was reportedly expanding the investigation into Russia\u2019s alleged involvement in the 2016 presidential election. In this last and most troubling scenario, Trump, eager to hinder the FBI\u2019s search\u2014or simply wishing to avoid a prolonged PR disaster\u2014instructed his staff to find an excuse, no matter how old, to cut the head off the proverbial snake.\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions, who had publicly recused himself from the Russia investigation, was involved in the decision of removing Comey and will be involved in choosing the next FBI director. If impeding the FBI\u2019s investigation really was the objective, Trump will now be able to select a prosecutor friendly to the White House. Whoever is selected will also have their predecessor\u2019s fate as a reminder of what happens to directors who dare challenge the president. In such a scenario, it is also unlikely the attorney general (who helped him get rid of Comey) would appoint a special prosecutor.","Donald Trump has said he was thinking of \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d when he decided James Comey\u2019s fate \u2013 contradicting the White House rationale that he fired the FBI director for mishandling the Clinton email investigation.\n\nComey had been leading an investigation into possible collusion between Trump advisers and Russian officials when he was dismissed by the president. Defending that decision in an interview on NBC News on Thursday, Trump said: \u201cAnd, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said: \u2018You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story, it\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should\u2019ve won.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump also said there were three occasions on which Comey assured him he was not under investigation. The president said he called the director of the FBI to ask for an update on a possible criminal investigation into his ties with Russia.\n\nActing FBI head disputes White House claim Comey had lost staff support\nRead more\nIn the NBC interview Trump also flatly contradicted his own vice-president and spokesman by saying he decided to fire James Comey before receiving a recommendation from the deputy attorney general.\n\nTrump recalled three conversations with Comey about the FBI investigation into Russian interference in last year\u2019s presidential election. First, he said, there was a dinner which was also about Comey\u2019s future, raising the prospect that Trump could threaten his job.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to stay on at the FBI,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand I said I\u2019ll, you know, consider and see what happens \u2026 But we had a very nice dinner, and at that time he told me, \u2018You are not under investigation.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nActing FBI director refutes claims that staff lost faith in Comey\nThen there were two phone calls, one made by Trump, another by Comey. The president admitted: \u201cI actually asked him, yes. I said, \u2018If it\u2019s possible would you let me know, am I under investigation? He said: \u2018You are not under investigation.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe revelations are likely to trigger a fresh storm of criticism. Perceptions that Trump fired Comey because of the Russian investigation have been central to the controversy surrounding the dismissal. Meanwhile, Trump asking whether he was under investigation would not be illegal, but highly irregular. On Thursday, Trump\u2019s words earned immediate comparisons with then attorney general Loretta Lynch\u2019s controversial meeting with Bill Clinton last June, during the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state.\n\nMatthew Miller, a former spokesman for the Department of Justice, told MSNBC: \u201cIt\u2019s completely inappropriate for [Trump] to ask that question \u2026 It would also be a violation of DoJ rules for James Comey to answer it.\u201d\n\nAsked at Thursday\u2019s White House press briefing if it was inappropriate for Trump to have asked Comey if he was under investigation, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe it is.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a conflict of interest and neither do many of the legal scholars who\u2019ve been commenting on it over the last hour.\u201d Sanders did not identify which \u201clegal scholars\u201d that she was referring to.\n\nWhen the president fired Comey on Tuesday, the White House released a memo from deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein that criticised Comey for mishandling last year\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Press secretary Sean Spicer claimed it was this memo that prompted Trump to remove Comey, a position backed by vice-president Mike Pence on Wednesday.\n\nPence said in an interview with CNN that Trump had \u201cmade a decision to accept the recommendation of the deputy attorney general and the attorney general to remove Director Comey.\u201d\n\nBut in the NBC interview, Trump said of Comey: \u201cHe\u2019s a showboat, he\u2019s a grandstander, the FBI has been in turmoil. You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that. You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago. It hasn\u2019t recovered from that.\u201d\n\nHe explained: \u201cI was going to fire Comey. My decision. I was going to fire Comey. There\u2019s no good time to do it, by the way. I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.\u201d\n\nThe revelation came amid a flurry of reports suggesting that Trump had grown increasingly irate with Comey in recent weeks because of his high profile, his failure to stop leaks, his pursuit of the Russia investigation and his lack of support for the president\u2019s claim that he was wiretapped by Barack Obama.\n\nIn the end, he fired Comey late on Tuesday afternoon, a move that seemed to take many White House staff by surprise. The official reason given was the FBI director\u2019s mishandling of the investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nThe acting head of the FBI, meanwhile, said on Thursday that Comey enjoyed broad support among its staff \u2013 directly contradicting the White House assertion that he had lost the confidence of the FBI rank and file.\n\nConfronted at a Senate intelligence committee hearing with the claim of Comey\u2019s unpopularity, Andrew McCabe said: \u201cThat is not accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can tell you I worked very, very closely [with Comey] from the time we started at the Washington field office,\u201d he said. \u201cI hold Director Comey in the highest regard for his considerable abilities and his integrity. It is the greatest honour of my professional life to have worked with him. He enjoyed broad support in the FBI and he still does to this day \u2026 the vast majority of FBI staff enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Sanders told reporters on Thursday that she had been in contact with \u201ccountless\u201d FBI agents via text and email who expressed their support for the decision. She did not identify them or explain why a White House press staffer would be in contact with FBI agents.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Sanders told CBS News Trump was \u201cvery likely\u201d to visit FBI headquarters \u201cin the next few days\u201d. But later the MSNBC network reported that the visit would not be happening after agency officials told the White House that Trump would not be greeted warmly.\n\nMaking his first public appearance since Comey\u2019s dismissal, McCabe promised to tell the Senate committee if he came under pressure to shut down the investigation into possible links between Trump\u2019s associates and Russia during last year\u2019s election. He said he had met Trump this week but the Russian investigation did not come up.\n\nAsked by Senator Marco Rubio if Comey\u2019s abrupt dismissal would impede the work of the FBI, McCabe was adamant.\n\n\u201cYou cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing and upholding the constitution,\u201d he said. Later he said the Russian investigation would be pursued \u201cvigorously and completely\u201d.\n\nTo reports of Comey having asked for more resources for the investigation, McCabe said he was not aware of any such request and insisted the Russian investigation had the resources it needed.\n\nOpening the hearing on global threats that heard evidence from the heads of the main US intelligence agencies, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, Richard Burr, said it would not be solely focused on the Trump-Russia enquiry. However, Democratic senators repeatedly returned to the issue.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to ignore that one of the leaders of the intelligence community is not here with us today,\u201d said the top Democrat on the committee, Mark Warner. \u201cThe president\u2019s firing of FBI director Comey \u2026 was a shocking development.\n\n\u201cThe timing of Director Comey\u2019s dismissal to me and many committee members on both sides of the aisle is especially troubling. He was leading an active counterintelligence investigation into any links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government or its representatives, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in our election.\n\u201cFor many people, including myself, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the president\u2019s decision to remove Director Comey was related to this investigation. And that is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nIt emerged on Wednesday evening that the committee had issued a subpoena for the president\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, requesting \u201cdocuments relevant to the committee\u2019s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election\u201d.\n\nComey \u2013 who found out he had been fired when the news flashed up on a screen behind him when he was addressing staff in Los Angeles \u2013 sent a farewell letter to FBI staff on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy hope is that you will continue to live our values and the mission of protecting the American people and upholding the constitution.\u201d","As genetically modified (GM) foods are starting to intrude in our diet concerns have been expressed regarding GM food safety. These concerns as well as the limitations of the procedures followed in the evaluation of their safety are presented. Animal toxicity studies with certain GM foods have shown that they may toxically affect several organs and systems. The review of these studies should not be conducted separately for each GM food, but according to the effects exerted on certain organs it may help us create a better picture of the possible health effects on human beings. The results of most studies with GM foods indicate that they may cause some common toxic effects such as hepatic, pancreatic, renal, or reproductive effects and may alter the hematological, biochemical, and immunologic parameters. However, many years of research with animals and clinical trials are required for this assessment. The use of recombinant GH or its expression in animals should be re-examined since it has been shown that it increases IGF-1 which may promote cancer.","You don't have to look hard to find genetically modified food on supermarket shelves: More than 85 percent of the corn and soy grown in the United States comes from seeds whose DNA has been rejiggered (to increase yields), and those two crops play starring roles in countless processed foods, from soda to salad dressing to bread. Advocates say genetically modified (GM) foods allow farmers to produce more with fewer chemicals\u2014which means a cleaner environment and cheaper groceries for us all. But the question remains: What impact do GM foods have on our health?\n\nThe answer is, no one really knows. GM foods have been on the market only since 1994, and research on their long-term effects on humans is scarce. To date most of the studies have been done on animals; worryingly, though, some of those studies link GM foods to altered metabolism, inflammation, kidney and liver malfunction, and reduced fertility. In one experiment, multiple generations of hamsters were fed a diet of GM soy; by the third generation, they were losing the ability to produce offspring, producing about half as many pups as the non-GM soy group.\n\nIn addition, allergy sufferers worry that, as genes are transferred between plants, allergenic proteins (from, say, peanuts or wheat) will pop up in unexpected places (like soy or sugar). Richard Goodman, PhD, a professor of food science and technology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a former scientist for Monsanto, says that seed companies run sophisticated tests to prevent that kind of mistake from happening. But inserting new genes into a seed's delicately constructed genome is always a gamble because scientists can't predict all the consequences. There is, for example, the possibility of creating brand-new allergens.\n\nDespite the potential health implications, more GM foods appear each year. In 2011 the USDA approved the planting of genetically enhanced sugar beets (sucrose) and alfalfa (hay for livestock). The FDA is expected to okay a fast-growing salmon in the near future. And possibly on the horizon: pigs designed to produce omega-3s.\n\nYet because GM foods are not required to be labeled as such, it's impossible for consumers to tell them apart from regular foods. Gary Hirshberg, chairman and cofounder of Stonyfield, the organic yogurt company, thinks that's not right. Last October he partnered with Just Label It, a national coalition of nearly 450 organizations that's currently petitioning the FDA to give consumers a choice. More than 600,000 people have already signed. (To add your name, go to justlabelit.org.)\n\n\"The status quo is innocent until proven guilty,\" says Ashley Koff, a registered dietitian who studies GM foods, \"as it was for trans fats, DDT, and countless other harmful chemicals. A labeling requirement would motivate seed companies to prove to consumers that their products are safe, to protect their sales.\" Nearly 50 other countries\u2014including China, Brazil, and most European nations\u2014have mandated that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) be marked, and in an MSNBC online poll, 96 percent of more than 45,000 respondents said that they should be labeled. At press time, 18 states had introduced legislation to promote GMO labeling.\n\nHirshberg, for one, remains impatient. \"I'm 57,\" he says. \"I don't want to wait another 30 years to see what the science says. At this point, I want to decide for myself.\" ","Over the past few years, a number of countries have completely banned GMOs and the pesticides that go along with them, and they are doing so for a reason. The latest country to consider a complete ban is Russia after top government scientists recommended at least a 10 year ban.\n\nThe truth is, we don\u2019t know enough about GMOs to deem them safe for human consumption. Believe it or not the very first commercial sale of them was only twenty years ago. There is no possible way that our health authorities can test all possible combinations on a large enough population, over a long enough period of time to be able to say with absolute certainty that they are harmless.\n\nThere are a multitude of credible scientific studies that clearly demonstrate why GMOs should not be consumed, and more are emerging every year.  There are also a number of scientists all around the world that oppose them.\n\nBy slipping it into our food without our knowledge, without any indication that there are genetically modified organisms in our food, we are now unwittingly part of a massive experiment.The FDA has said that genetically modified organisms are not much different from regular food, so they\u2019ll be treated in the same way. The problem is this, geneticists follow the inheritance of genes, what biotechnology allows us to do is to take this organism, and move it horizontally into a totally unrelated species. Now David Suzuki doesn\u2019t normally mate with a carrot and exchange genes, what biotechnology allows us to do is to switch genes from one to the other without regard to the biological constraints. It\u2019s very very bad science, we assume that the principals governing the inheritance of genes vertically, applies when you move genes laterally or horizontally. There\u2019s absolutely no reason to make that conclusion \u2013 Geneticist David Suzuki\n\nIf anybody ever tells you that we know with one hundred percent certainty that GMOs are totally safe to eat, they haven\u2019t done their research. There is no reason GM foods should be approved safe for consumption, we just don\u2019t know enough about them. We could easily feed the planet through organic, GMO free methods, there is absolutely no reason we need GM foods around.\n\nBelow I\u2019ve presented just a bit of information to get you started on your research if you\u2019re interested.\n\n1. Multiple Toxins From GMOs Detected In Maternal and Fetal Blood\n\nResearch from Canada (the first of its kind) has successfully identified the presence of pesticides -associated with genetically modified foods in maternal, fetal and non-pregnant women\u2019s blood. They also found the presence of Monsanto\u2019s Bt toxin. The study was published in the Journal Reproductive Toxicology in 2011.(1) You can read the FULL study here.\n\n\u201cGiven the potential toxicity of these environmental pollutants and the fragility of the fetus, more studies are needed, particularly those using the placental transfer approach. Thus, our present results will provide baseline data for future studies exploring a new area of research relating to nutrition, toxicology and reproduction in women. Today, obstetric-gynecological disorders that are associated with environmental chemicals are not known.  Thus, knowing the actual concentration of genetically modified foods in humans constitutes a cornerstone in the advancement of research in this area.\u201d (1)\n\nThe study used blood samples from thirty pregnant women and thirty non-pregnant women. The study also pointed out that the fetus is considered to be highly susceptible to the adverse affects of xenobiotics (foreign chemical substance found within an organism that is not naturally produced.)  This is why the study emphasizes that knowing more about GMOs is crucial, because environmental agents could disrupt the biological events that are required to ensure normal growth and development.\n\n2. DNA From Genetically Modified Crops Can Be Transferred Into Humans Who Eat Them\n\nIn a new study published in the peer reviewed Public Library of Science (PLOS), researchersemphasize that there is sufficient evidence that meal-derived DNA fragments carry complete genes that can enter into the human circulation system through an unknown mechanism.(2)\n\nIn one of the blood samples the relative concentration of plant DNA is higher than the human DNA.  The study was based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four independent studies. PLOS is an open access, well respected peer-reviewed scientific journal that covers primary research from disciplines within science and medicine. It\u2019s great to see this study published in it, confirming what many have been suspected for years.\n\n\u201cOur bloodstream is considered to be an environment well separated from the outside world and the digestive tract. According to the standard paradigm large macromolecules consumed with food cannot pass directly to the circulatory system. During digestion proteins and DNA are thought to be degraded into small constituents, amino acids and nucleic acids, respectively, and then absorbed by a complex active process and distributed to various parts of the body through the circulation system. Here, based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four independent studies, we report evidence that meal-derived DNA fragments which are large enough to carry complete genes can avoid degradation and through an unknown mechanism enter the human circulation system. In one of the blood samples the relative concentration of plant DNA is higher than the human DNA. The plant DNA concentration shows a surprisingly precise log-normal distribution in the plasma samples while non-plasma (cord blood) control sample was found to be free of plant DNA.\u201d (2)\n\nThis still doesn\u2019t mean that GMOs can enter into our cells, but given the fact GMOs have been linked to cancer (later in this article) it is safe to assume it is indeed a possibility. The bottom line is that we don\u2019t know, and this study demonstrates another cause for concern.\n\n3. New Study Links GMOs To Gluten Disorders That Affect 18 Million Americans\n\nThis study was recently released by the Institute for Responsible Technology (IRT), and uses data from the US department of Agriculture, US Environmental Protection Agency, medical journal reviews as well as other independent research. (3)(4) The authors relate GM foods to five conditions that may either trigger or exacerbate gluten-related disorders, including the autoimmune disorder, Celiac Disease:\n\nIntestinal permeability\nImbalanced gut bacteria\nImmune activation and allergic response\nImpaired digestion\nDamage to the intestinal wall\nThe Institute for Responsible technology is a world leader in educating policy makers and the public about GMO foods and crops. The institute reports and investigates on the impact GM foods can have on health, environment, agriculture and more.\n\n4. Study Links Genetically Modified Corn to Rat Tumors\n\nIn November 2012, The Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology published a paper titled \u2018Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize\u2019 by Gilles-Eric Seralini and his team of researchers at France\u2019s Caen University. (5)\n\nIt was a very significant study, which obviously looks bad for the big bio tech companies like Monsanto, being the first and only long term study under controlled conditions examining the possible effects of a diet of GMO maize treated with Monsanto roundup herbicide.\n\nThis study has since been retracted, which is odd, because the journal it was published in is a very well known, reputable peer reviewed scientific journal. In order for a study to be published here it has to go through a rigorous review process.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that hundreds of scientists from around the world have condemned the retraction of the study. This study was done by experts, and a correlation between GMOs and these tumors can\u2019t be denied, something happened.\n\nThe multiple criticisms of the study have also been answered by the team of researchers that conducted the study. You can read them and find out more about the study here.\n\nGM Crop Production is Lowering US Yields and Increasing Pesticide Use\n\n5. Glyphosate Induces Human Breast Cancer Cells Growth via Estrogen Receptors\n\nA study is published in the US National Library of Medicine (4) and will soon be published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology. Several recent studies showed glyphosate\u2019s potential to be an endocrine disruptor. Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere with the hormone system in mammals. These disruptors can cause developmental disorders, birth defects and cancer tumors. (6)\n\nGlyphosate exerted proliferative effects only in human hormone-dependent breast cancer. We found that glyphosate exhibited a weaker estrogenic activity than estradiol. Furthermore, this study demonstrated the additive estrogenic effects of glyphosate and genisein which implied that the use of contaminated soybean products as dietary supplements may pose a risk of breast cancer because of their potential additive estrogenicity. (6)\n\nResearchers also determined that Monsanto\u2019s roundup is considered an \u201cxenoestrogen,\u201d which is a foreign estrogen that mimics real estrogen in our bodies. This can cause a number of problems that include an increased risk of various cancers, early onset of puberty, thyroid issues, infertility and more.\n\n6. Glyphosate Linked To Birth Defects\n\nA group of scientists put together a comprehensive review of existing data that shows how European regulators have known that Monsanto\u2019s glyphosate causes a number of birth malformations since at least 2002. Regulators misled the public about glyphosate\u2019s safety, and in Germany the Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety told the European Commission that there was no evidence to suggest that glyphosate causes birth defects. (7)\n\nOur examination of the evidence leads us to the conclusion that the current approval of glyphosate and Roundup is deeply flawed and unreliable. In this report, we examine the industry studies and regulatory documents that led to the approval of glyphosate. We show that industry and regulators knew as long ago as the 1980s and 1990s that glyphosate causes malformation \u2013 but that this information was not made public. We demonstrate how EU regulators reasoned their way from clear evidence of glyphosate\u2019s teratogenicity in industry\u2019s own studies to a conclusion that minimized these findings in the EU Commission\u2019s final review report (7)\n\nHere is a summary of the report:\n\nMultiple peer-reviewed scientific literature documenting serious health hazards posed by glyphosate\nIndustry (including Monsanto) has known since the 1980?s that glyphosate causes malformations in experimental animals at high doses\nIndustry has known since 1993 that these effects could also occur at lower and mid doses\nThe German government has known since at least 1998 that glyphosate causes malformations\nThe EU Commission\u2019s expert scientific review panel knew in 1999 that glyphosate causes malformations\nThe EU Commission has known since 2002 that glyphosate causes malformations. This was the year DG SANCO division published its final review report, laying out the basis for the current approval of glyphosate\nAnother study published by the American Chemical Society, from the university of Buenos Aires, Argentina also showed that Glyphosate can cause abnormalities.(8)\n\nThe direct effect of glyphosate on early mechanisms of morphogenesis in vertebrate embryos opens concerns about the clinical findings from human offspring in populations exposed to glyphosate in agricultural fields (8)\n\n7. Study Links Glyphosate To Autism, Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s\n\nWhen you ingest Glyphosate, you are in essence altering the chemistry of your body. It\u2019s completely unnatural and the body doesn\u2019t resonate with it. P450 (CYP) is the gene pathway disrupted when the body takes in Glyphosate. P450 creates enzymes that assist with the formation of molecules in cells, as well as breaking them down. CYP enzymes are abundant and have many important functions. They are responsible for detoxifying xenobiotics from the body, things like the various chemicals found in pesticides, drugs and carcinogens. Glyphosate inhibits the CYP enzymes. The CYP pathway is critical for normal, natural functioning of multiple biological systems within our bodies. Because humans that\u2019ve been exposed to glyphosate have a drop in amino acid tryptophan levels, they do not have the necessary active signalling of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is associated with weight gain, depression and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. (9)\n\n8. Chronically Ill Humans Have Higher Glyphosate Levels Than Healthy Humans\n\nA new study out of Germany concludes that Glyphosate residue could reach humans and animals through feed and can be excreted in urine. It outlines how presence of glyphosate in urine and its accumulation in animal tissues is alarming even at low concentrations. (10)\n\nTo this day, Monsanto continues to advertise its Roundup products as environmentally friendly and claims that neither animals nor humans are affected by this toxin. Environmentalists, veterinarians, medical doctors and scientists however, have raised increasing alarms about the danger of glyphosate in the animal and human food chain as well as the environment. The fact that glyphosate has been found in animals and humans is of great concern. In search for the causes of serious diseases amongst entire herds of animals in northern Germany, especially cattle, glyphosate has repeatedly been detected in the urine, feces, milk and feed of the animals. Even more alarming, glyphosate was detected in the urine of the farmers.  (10)\n\n9. Studies Link GMO Animal Feed to Severe Stomach Inflammation and Enlarged Uteri in Pigs\n\nA study by scientist Judy Carman, PhD that was recently published in the peer reviewed journal Organic Systems outlines the effects of a diet mixed with GMO feed for pigs, and how it is a cause for concern when it comes to health. (11) Scientists randomized and fed isowean pigs either a mixed GM soy and GM corn (maize) diet for approximately 23 weeks (nothing out of the ordinary for most pigs in the United States), which is unfortunately the normal lifespan of a commercial pig from weaning to slaughter. Equal numbers of male and female pigs were present in each group. The GM diet was associated with gastric and uterine differences in pigs. GM pigs had uteri that were 25% heavier than non-GM fed pigs. GM-fed pigs had a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation with a rate of 32% compared to 125 of non-GM fed pigs.\n\nThe study concluded that pigs fed a GMO diet exhibited a heavier uteri and a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation than pigs who weren\u2019t fed a GMO diet. Because the use of GMO feed for livestock and humans is so widespread, this is definitely another cause for concern when it comes to GMO consumption. Humans have a similar gastrointestinal tract to pigs, and these GM crops are consumed widely by people, especially in the United States.\n\n10. GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the testing methods recommended are not adequate to ensure safety. (12)(13)(14)\n\nDeficiencies have been revealed numerous times with regards to testing GM foods.\n\nThe first guidelines were originally designed to regulate the introduction of GM microbes and plants into the environment with no attention being paid to food safety concerns. However, they have been widely cited as adding authoritative scientific support to food safety assessment. Additionally, the Statement of Policy released by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, presumptively recognizing the GM foods as GRAS (generally recognized as safe), was prepared while there were critical guidelines prepared by the International Life Sciences Institute Europe and FAO/WHO recommend that safety evaluation should be based on the concept of substantial equivalence, considering parameters such as molecular characterization, phenotypic characteristics, key nutrients, toxicants and allergens. Since 2003, official standards for food safety assessment have been published by the Codex Alimentarius Commission of FAO/WHO. Published reviews with around 25 peer-reviewed studies have found that despite the guidelines, the risk assessment of GM foods has not followed a defined prototype.(12) (15)\n\n\u201cThe risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) crops for human nutrition and health has not been systematic. Evaluations for each GM crop or trait have been conducted using different feeding periods, animal models and parameters. The most common results is that GM and conventional sources include similar nutritional performance and growth in animals. However, adverse microscopic and molecular effects of some GM foods in different organs or tissues have been reported. While there are currently no standardized methods to evaluate the safety of GM foods, attempts towards harmonization are on the way. More scientific effort is necessary in order to build confidence in the evaluation and acceptance of GM foods.\u201d (12) (15)\n\nSo, if anybody ever tells you that GMOs are completely safe for consumption, it\u2019s not true. We just don\u2019t know enough about them to make such a definitive statement. A lot of evidence actually points to the contrary.\n\nSources:\n\n(1) https://www.uclm.es/Actividades/repositorio/pdf/doc_3721_4666.pdf\n\n(2) http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0069805\n\n(3) http://rt.com/usa/gmo-gluten-sensitivity-trigger-343/\n\n(4) http://responsibletechnology.org/media/images/content/Press_Release_Gluten_11_25.pdf\n\n(5) http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512005637\n\n(6) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23756170\n\n(7) http://earthopensource.org/files/pdfs/Roundup-and-birth-defects/RoundupandBirthDefectsv5.pdf\n\n(8) http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/tx1001749\n\n(9) http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/15/4/1416\n\n(10) http://omicsonline.org/open-access/detection-of-glyphosate-residues-in-animals-and-humans-2161-0525.1000210.pdf\n\n(11) http://www.organic-systems.org/journal/81/8106.pdf\n\n(12) http://static.aboca.com/www.aboca.com/files/attach/news/risk_assessment_of_genetically_modified_crops_for_nutrition.pdf\n\n(13) Reese W, Schubert D.

One recent example of this\u2014\u201d10 Scientific Studies Proving GMOs Can Be Harmful To Human Health\u201c, posted on Collective-Evolution.com\u2014outlines many familiar concerns and points in each case to \u201ccredible scientific studies that clearly demonstrate why GMOs should not be consumed\u201d.\n\nAre these concerns credible? What do the studies cited actually claim?\n\n1) Multiple Toxins From GMOs Detected In Maternal and Fetal Blood.\n\nThe blog post sites a 2010 study that alleges to show this danger. The authors identified the Bt protein Cry1Ab in maternal and fetal blood, a protein found in some GMOs, but also commonly used as a pesticide in organic farming. The paper is flawed. The researchers\u2019 measurements were based on an experiment/assay designed to detect Bt\u2019s Cry1Ab in plants, not in humans. As this post in Biofortified.org explains, the pregnant women in the study would have had to eat several kilos of corn in order to get the Bt measurements that were detected in their blood.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s the \u201cso what\u201d factor. Humans lack the receptors for the protein, so it has no impact on us. Did you know that chocolate is toxic to dogs? Are you concerned that it might be toxic to you? Probably not (if you are concerned, then you\u2019ve missed out on the greatest source of joy known to human taste buds\u2026). Some chemical compounds behave differently among species, and both Bt\u2018s Cry1Ab and chocolate are examples of this.\n\n2) DNA From Genetically Modified Crops Can Be Transferred Into Humans Who Eat Them\n\nThat\u2019s not what the cited 2013 study concluded. The authors found that whole genes from our food can be detected in our plasma. That does not mean that they\u2019ve integrated into our DNA; it means that they\u2019ve been found floating in the space between cells. And that\u2019s any food, not just GMOs. DNA from GMOs behave no differently than DNA from organic or conventional foods\n\nIf you aren\u2019t concerned about the DNA from blueberries \u201ctransferring\u201d into you, then you should not be concerned about DNA from GMOs either. The paper\u2019s deepest flaw is that a negative control was not included in the sequencing experiments. Several recent papers (see here and here) have outlined the importance of including a negative control in experiments where there is very little DNA to account for possible contaminants from the environment and reagents. (For a lay introduction to the concept of contaminants in sequencing, see here).\n\n3) New Study Links GMOs To Gluten Disorders That Affect 18 Million Americans\n\nThe article quotes for an alleged \u201cstudy\u201d by the Institute for Responsible Technology (IRT). But there is no study on the link of GMOs to gluten allergies. There\u2019s a link to a post on a webpage, but there isn\u2019t a peer-reviewed article. IRT is a one-man band run by activist Jeffrey Smith. It is an NGO that advocates for the elimination of GMOs from our food supply. It\u2019s not a university, college or research institution. It doesn\u2019t do studies.\n\nI\u2019ve written about gluten allergies and GMOs. The Celiac Disease foundation has spoken out against the IRT\u2019s report. GMO wheat has not been commercialized, so any association of gluten allergies with the consumption of GMO wheat is on its face absurd. As for charts that track an increase in GMO consumption in general and gluten allergies, it\u2019s a case of association with no causation (i.e. the incidence of gluten allergies have increased over the past decade and the amount of GMOs we eat have increased too. But, so have the number of plasma screens manufactured).\n\n4) Study Links Genetically Modified Corn to Rat Tumors\n\nThis claim is the infamous Seralini paper, which was retracted, and recently republished, in a different journal without being peer reviewed. The paper identified tumors in rats that were fed GMOs and/or the herbicide glyphosate longterm. But the strain of rat used was predisposed to tumors. The paper did not perform statistical analyses and used too few rats, so it was not possible to determine if the tumors were due to the food, the chemical or to the fact that the strain of rats would get tumors regardless of what they were fed. Finally, the findings from Seralini\u2019s paper are contrary to other long-term feeding studies. An overview of the criticisms regarding this paper can be found here.\n\n5) Glyphosate Induces Human Breast Cancer Cells Growth via Estrogen Receptors\n\nThis claim relates to glyphosate, an herbicide used in tandem with herbicide resistant genetically modified crops. The cited paper examines the impact of glyphosate on breast cancer cell growth. In approximately 80 percent of instances of breast cancer, the diseased cells are hormone sensitive, meaning they need estrogen in order to proliferate and spread. These researchers took two breast cancer cell lines: one was estrogen sensitive and one was not, and they examined the impact of increasing amounts of glyphosate on cell growth. They found that glyphosate has similar impact on breast cancer growth as estrogen, although the relationship was not as strong, and it did not have an impact on the proliferation of the non-hormone sensitive breast cancer cell line.\n\nThe paper had numerous technical problems, including the absence of data on controls, a potentially critical omission. Additionally, there actually seems to be a protective effect at higher concentrations of glyphosate: instead of reaching a saturation point where the addition of glyphosate no longer has an effect on cell growth, there is no significant difference in cellular growth between the cells that received the highest doses of glyphosate and the controls  (which is why the data from the controls is an important factor).\n\nThis experiment was done with cells in a petri dish\u2014what\u2019s called an in vitro tissue-culture experiment. Such research is of limited real-world value. The cells are often finicky and need plenty of TLC in order to grow well; different cell lines can also behave very differently. The authors of the paper note some of these issues, along with the fact that their data doesn\u2019t mesh with previous studies that have examined the impact of glyphosate on cellular proliferation (this previous paper suggests that glyphosate actually protects against cell proliferation in vitro in eight different cancer cell lines and that glyphosate might be developed into an anti-cancer drug!).\n\nMonsanto wrote a response to the paper noting that many studies examined the potential carcinogenicity of glyphosate and none has found that the compound causes cancer. Some news reports misinterpreted the study, writing that researchers concluded that glyphosate causes cancer when that is not the researchers\u2019 findings: they suggest glyphosate may cause breast cancer to proliferate. Monsanto pointed out that even this finding is contrary to the body of evidence that exists on the topic. The authors admit to this fact and discuss the appropriate next steps to examine this issue in mice/rats models for breast cancer. I think that that\u2019s a great next step. I\u2019d also look at a few more breast-cancer cell lines.\n\nThis is the most compelling research paper that I\u2019ve read about that suggests a potential health risk surrounding glyphosate. But the study must be reproduced and its issues ironed out. However, as I mentioned, the paper isn\u2019t really about GMOs as a class: keep in mind that only a fraction of GMOs are glyphosate resistant (i.e. Round-up Ready crops) and the use of glyphosate is not limited to GMOs.\n\nAdditionally, the paper does several experiments with a compound in soybean whose impact on breast cancer cell growth is very similar to that of glyphosate\u2019s\u2014meaning that there are \u201cnatural\u201d compounds in our food that seem to have the same impact on breast-cancer proliferation that this paper\u2019s findings suggest for glyphosate. There does not seem to be a scientific consensus on the topic of soy intake in breast cancer patients, although several publications have examined this issue without finding a positive correlation (examples here, here, and here).\n\n6) Glyphosate Linked To Birth Defects\n\nNo peer reviewed, published scientific study makes such claims. The source of this health concern is a publication by Earth Open Source, an anti-GMO NGO co-founded by an individual who also owns a GMO-testing and certification company, and whose business would clearly benefit through the promotion of anti-GMO sentiments (see \u201cAbout the Authors\u201d in this document).\n\n7) Study Links Glyphosate To Autism, Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s\n\nThe paper that led to this health claim does not constitute research. It\u2019s a hypothesis and no research was done to support the hypothesis. The paper was reviewed by science journalist Keith Kloor at Discover Magazine who aptly compared it to a Glenn Beck chalkboard drawing.\n\nThe claims were printed in a pay-for-play journal (also known as predatory journal), meaning that for a fee, one can get nearly anything published. There have been several expos\u00e9s on pay-for-play journals, and many scientists believe that the phenomenon is eroding the quality of science (here\u2019s an overview from Nature.com; here\u2019s an expos\u00e9 of pay for play journals)\n\n8) Chronically Ill Humans Have Higher Glyphosate Levels Than Healthy Humans\n\nThis claim is based on a paper published in the Journal of Environmental and Analytical Toxicology, owned by the Omics publishing group- a notorious predatory publishing company.\n\nThe authors examined glyphosate levels in humans and different animals. There\u2019s no indication of what the animals were fed, how much, how they were kept or myriad other variables. Any of these could invalidate the study. The researchers do not say anything about the age, sex, weight, height, or genetic background of the humans, or how much they ate, if they washed their food, how long they had been eating organic/conventional diets and, most mind-blowing of all, there\u2019s absolutely no definition for what constitutes being \u201cchronically ill\u201d. Any single issue that I\u2019ve listed here would be considered a fatal flaw that would exclude the paper from publication in a more prestigious journal.\n\n9) Studies Link GMO Animal Feed to Severe Stomach Inflammation and Enlarged Uteri in Pigs\n\nIn the study on which this claim is based, the researchers gave pigs GMO feed and non-GMO feed and identified the differences between the two groups. The paper has been thoroughly challenged by many journalists and scientists:\n\nJournalist Mark Lynas highlighted the degree to which the data is cherry-picked. The difference in \u201cinflammation\u201d between the GM-fed and non-GM-fed pigs is apparent only when you break down the degree of inflammation into subcategories, but there\u2019s no difference if you view it as a single category. Overall, there\u2019s a high rate of inflammation for both groups, which is not explained in the paper. At the same time, there are several parameters where GM-feed could be argued as having a protective effect (there are 50 percent fewer heart-abnormalities in pigs fed GM-grain), but this isn\u2019t discussed.\nAs explained by geneticist Anastasia Bodnar, the authors do not analyze the compositional differences in the feed between the two groups. Previous studies have determined that the environment (i.e., water, soil, geography) of a crop has a greater impact on proteins and metabolites than whether or not the crop is a GMO. As such, the differences seen in the pigs may not be due pesticides or presence/absence of the transgenic protein; rather, they are most likely due to differences in composition of the feed\nGeneticist Val Giddings notes that the animals had abnormally high rates of pneumonia, which points to the possibility that something wonky was going on.\nIn conclusion, even if the paper\u2019s findings are real, there\u2019s no knowing whether that\u2019s due to something associated with transgenes or not, because the researchers do not account for natural variation in the feed.\n\n10) GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the testing methods recommended are not adequate to ensure safety.\n\nLet\u2019s set aside the fact that this isn\u2019t a \u201cScientific Study Proving GMOs Can Be Harmful To Human Health,\u201d which is the claim set out in the title. There are three papers associated with this bullet point. The first one is a review and I agree with a few of the points it makes. It highlights the need for standardized tests and statistics in animal feeding studies for GMOs, and anyone who followed the Seralini debacle would probably agree. It summarizes papers that have performed feeding studies and their results. However, the review does not remove flawed papers from their overview and nor does it distinguish between feeding studies for GMO crops that have been commercialized vs. crops that have never been submitted for regulatory approval. The paper does not conclude, \u201cGMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence\u201d.\n\nThe second paper is also a review piece. The first author is affiliated with \u201cFriends of the Earth,\u201d an anti-GMO NGO. It does not constitute novel research and has a clear editorial slant.\n\nThe third paper does not even qualify as a review. It\u2019s a commentary published in 2002 in Nature Biotechnology, which is a high caliber journal. It outlined possible unintended consequences that could happen with a GMO\u2014none of which have ever been documented or identified since then, to the best of my knowledge.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the title of the article, none of these studies proves or even persuasively suggests that GMOs can be harmful to human health. The majority are either obviously flawed or are not scientific studies.\n\nThe current scientific consensus regarding GMOs remains unchanged: they are safe and do not pose a health risk to humans. However, a scientific consensus is subject to change if there is sufficient reproducible evidence that may impact it, but none of the studies reviewed here constitute such evidence.","It\u2019s been several months since the intelligence community concluded Russia tampered in the election, including stealing Democratic Party emails and giving them to WikiLeaks.\n\nYet an unfounded conspiracy theory persists: that WikiLeaks actually got the emails from a Democratic National Committee staffer who was shot and killed in July 2016.\n\nSeth Rich, who worked on voter access projects for the DNC, was 27 when he was killed early in the morning near his Washington home. Ten months later, the case remains unsolved, though Washington police have said they believe it was likely a botched robbery.\n\nWikiLeaks published tens of thousands of internal DNC emails several days after Rich died, leading conspiracy theorists to speculate that the two events were related. WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information about Rich\u2019s murder.\n\nThe story is back in the news because on May 15, a private investigator looking into Rich\u2019s case said he had evidence to prove the theorists right.\n\nBut the investigator, a man named Rod Wheeler, backtracked on his claims the next day, and the Rich family has sent him a cease-and-desist letter, saying their son was not WikiLeaks\u2019 source.\n\nEven so, some right-wing pundits continue to peddle this conspiracy, most prominently on Fox News. Among them are host Sean Hannity and former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n\n\"We have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee, who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments,\" Gingrich said on Fox May 21. \"Nobody\u2019s investigating that, and what does that tell you about what was going on? Because it turns out, it wasn\u2019t the Russians.\"\n\nContrary to Gingrich\u2019s statement, the thin case that Rich was the DNC leaker is in no way substantial enough to outweigh ample evidence that Russia was the culprit. Two days after Gingrich made this claim, Fox News retracted its report promoting this conspiracy theory.\n\nScant evidence that Seth Rich leaked the emails\nThe latest iteration of this story started when Wheeler spoke to a reporter with Washington local news station WWTG-TV on May 15.\n\nWheeler worked for the Washington police in the 1990s and is an occasional Fox News contributor. Texas businessman Ed Butowsky, another Fox News contributor, is financing Wheeler\u2019s investigation.\n\nWheeler told WWTG-TV he believes the local police and the FBI are engaged in a cover-up because of information found on Rich\u2019s laptop and the relationship between the Washington mayor\u2019s office and the DNC.\n\n\"But you have sources at the FBI saying there is information that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?\" asked the WTTG-TV reporter.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Wheeler replied. \"Yeah, and that\u2019s confirmed.\"\n\nThe next day, a national Fox News report said an unnamed federal investigator corroborated Wheeler\u2019s findings. And according to the federal investigator, an FBI analysis of Rich\u2019s laptop found that Rich made contact with a WikiLeaks director and sent him 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments from DNC leaders.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Hours after Fox published its report, Wheeler recanted. He told CNN that he hadn\u2019t seen the evidence himself, and his knowledge of Rich\u2019s alleged email contact with WikiLeaks came from the national Fox News reporter, not his own investigative work.\n\n\"Let me just really quickly say this,\" Wheeler said on Hannity\u2019s show May 16. \"I don't know for sure, I don't know as a matter of fact if the emails went out to the WikiLeaks or anybody else, but it sure appears that way.\"\n\nFox retracted its own May 16 article, saying \"the article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting.\"\n\nSo this allegation that Rich was the real DNC leaker \u2014 and related insinuation that Rich was murdered because of it \u2014 rests nearly entirely on claims from a single unnamed federal investigator with unspecified connections to the case.\n\nThe theory also doesn\u2019t make much logical sense. No evidence has emerged that shows Rich was so disgruntled with the DNC that he felt the need to expose its leaders to WikiLeaks. Further, the leaked emails were overall rather mild. They were embarrassing and prompted Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida to step down from her role as DNC chair, but they didn\u2019t expose any conspiracies or illegal activity.\n\nAll of this together makes for a pretty flimsy case, especially when compared to the broad consensus that Russian actors were the true culprit.\n\nLots of evidence Russia stole, then leaked, the emails\nThe intelligence community and private cybersecurity professionals have widely concluded that the DNC hack and WikiLeaks dump are covered in Russian fingerprints.\n\nThe technical methods behind the hack were similar to those used by two Russian intelligence groups, dubbed APT28 and APT29, also known as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear. And experts have said that dumping large quantities of stolen political information is a signature move of Russian influence operations.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the Russian government have a well-documented relationship. Assange has hosted a television show on RT, a state-owned network, for example.\n\nVarious intelligence agencies reiterated Russia\u2019s culpability in official reports in October, December and January. And intelligence community leaders and experts in Russia and cybersecurity have said they agreed with this conclusion in testimony before Congress in the months since.\n\n\"The final piece of Russia's modern Active Measures surfaced in the summer of 2016 as hacked materials were strategically leaked,\" said Clint Watts, senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and former FBI special agent, in a March 30 Senate hearing. \"The disclosures of WikiLeaks, Guccifer 2.0 and DC Leaks demonstrated how hacks would power the influence system Russia had built so successfully in the previous two years.\"\n\nThere\u2019s evidence that Russia engaged in cyber operations against Republicans, too, though it wasn\u2019t as robust as the DNC hack.\n\n\"The Russians used cyber operations against both political parties, including hacking into servers used by the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen data to WikiLeaks and other media outlets,\" said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in a May hearing. \"Russia also collected on certain Republican Party-affiliated targets, but did not release any Republican-related data.\"\n\nOur ruling\nGingrich said DNC staffer Seth Rich \"apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments. ... It turns out, it wasn\u2019t the Russians.\"\n\nThere is no trustworthy evidence supporting the theory that Rich was WikiLeaks\u2019 source for thousands of DNC emails. The police believe his death was the result of a botched robbery, not a political assassination.\n\nThe intelligence community and cybersecurity experts have reached a broad conclusion that all the available evidence points to Russia as the actual perpetrators \u2014 based on technical indicators and an understanding of how Russian influence operations work.\n\nGingrich and others are talking about an unfounded conspiracy theory as if it's a matter of fact. It is far from it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.","On 16 May 2017, Fox News published an explosive report linking the death of murdered Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich to tens of thousands of e-mails allegedly found on his laptop computer. Fox reported that the e-mails were internal Democratic National Committee messages Rich transferred to Gavin McFayden, a now-deceased investigative journalist, who then sent them to the document-dumping web site WikiLeaks.\n\nThe Fox report claimed that there was a conspiracy between the local police department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the D.C. mayor\u2019s office to cover up the investigation:\n\nAn FBI forensic report of Rich\u2019s computer \u2014 generated within 96 hours after Rich\u2019s murder \u2014 showed he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time, the federal source told Fox News.\n\n\u201cI have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,\u201d the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.\n\nThe revelation is consistent with the findings of Wheeler, whose private investigation firm was hired by a third party on behalf of Rich\u2019s family to probe the case.\n\n\u201cMy investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cI do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters.\u201d\n\nThe federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.\nRich, a 27-year-old DNC staffer, was shot twice in the back at 4:20 in the morning on 10 July 2016 amid the run-up to the presidential election. Although none of his possessions were taken from him, Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police consider it a botched robbery attempt, because there had been a spate of muggings in Rich\u2019s Bloomingdale neighborhood at the time.\n\nAlmost two weeks later, on 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks dumped a load of hacked e-mails that would embarrass the DNC and create a media frenzy in the months before the election. The timing of the incidents, as well as Rich\u2019s employment at the DNC, led to conspiracy theories tying his death to the leak. Adding to the confusion, WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Rich\u2019s killer. Since his death, Rich\u2019s family has consistently denied rumors linking him to WikiLeaks.\n\nThe Fox News story about Rich came one day after a report by the Washington Post accused President Donald Trump of spilling classified information to Russian envoys during their visit to the Oval Office on 10 May 2017. Brad Bauman, a spokesperson for Rich\u2019s family, told us he believed the Fox story was motivated by a desire to deflect attention away from the Post report:\n\nI think there\u2019s a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda.\nThe Fox story uses two sources: Rod Wheeler, a Fox News contributor characterized as a private investigator in the article, and an unnamed \u201cfederal investigator.\u201d On 15 May 2017, Wheeler speculated to local news outlet Fox5 that there was critical information on a computer that belonged to him, which was either in the possession of the FBI or MPD:\n\nThe police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming. They haven\u2019t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer which I believe is either at the police department or at the FBI. I\u2019ve been told both.\nWheeler claimed to have a source at the FBI that \u201cconfirmed\u201d Rich was linked to WikiLeaks, and a source inside the police department who told him MPD was told to \u201cstand down\u201d from the investigation. In a follow-up interview on Fox News, Wheeler implied that a conspiracy reaching to the highest levels of the city\u2019s government was at work:\n\nI want to find out who caused that man\u2019s death so we can put them behind bars. But if there\u2019s somebody in politics, if there\u2019s somebody in government, whether it\u2019s the mayor\u2019s office or anywhere else in this city that\u2019s involved, you better believe they\u2019re going to be dragged in and questioned.\nWe were able to confirm the FBI is not investigating Rich\u2019s murder \u2014 it is an MPD investigation.\n\nWe reached out to Wheeler by e-mail and have yet to receive a response, but since the Fox story was published, he has been quoted in several news articles recanting his original story. He told BuzzFeed News the following day, \u201cThat story on Fox 5 last night was inaccurate. I don\u2019t even know where the computers are.\u201d\n\nOn 19 May 2017, the Rich family attorney sent Wheeler a cease and desist letter saying he had violated a contract forbidding him to publicly disclose information about the case and threatening to sue if he continues to do so.\n\nWe contacted the office of Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser to ask if there was a lurid connection between the mayor, the DNC, and Rich\u2019s death, and got a flat denial from spokesman Kevin Harris:\n\nAll claims made by Mr. Wheeler are false and take fake news to a whole new level. The family deserves better and everyday MPD continues to work diligently to solve this case.\nWe also asked the police department about Wheeler\u2019s claims that the department was stepping back from the investigation. A spokesperson for the department denied it and said that the investigation remains active:\n\nThe assertions put forward by Mr. Wheeler are unfounded. The Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s (MPD) Homicide Branch is actively investigating Mr. Rich\u2019s murder  and we continue to work with the family to bring closure to this case as we do with all homicide investigations. If there are any individuals who feel they have information, we urge them to call us at 202-727-9099 or text us at 50411.  The department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information on this case that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.\nBauman said in a statement that Wheeler was not authorized to speak on behalf of the family, and added the family only learned of the new round of accusations through news reports:\n\nEven if tomorrow, an e-mail was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions, as e-mails can be altered and we\u2019ve seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so. We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth\u2019s murderers. The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family, unless explicitly authorized by the family.\nMcFayden, an investigative journalist who was an early defender of WikiLeaks, died in October 2016 after a battle with lung cancer.\n\nAlthough the Fox report claims Wheeler is a private investigator, a search for Wheeler\u2019s name on the public lookup tool for licenses in Washington D.C. yields no results. We also checked for a license under his name in Maryland, where his firm Capitol Investigations is based. This search also yielded no results. When we asked MPD whether he was indeed a homicide detective with the department, they only confirmed he once worked there starting in 1990. He was dismissed by the department in 1995, but a spokesman did not explain why.\n\nWe sent an e-mail to Wheeler through his firm and have not yet received a response.\n\nNBC News identified the \u201cthird party\u201d who hired Wheeler to investigate Rich\u2019s murder as Ed Butowsky, a Dallas-based financial adviser, who is also a Fox News contributor.","\u201cMy investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks.\u201d\n- Rod Wheeler, former DC homicide investigator\n\nWheeler made his comments on the possible Rich-Wikileaks connection in a story first reported Monday night by Fox 5 DC.\n\nIn an appearance on Fox News' \"Hannity\" Tuesday night, Wheeler said a \"federal investigator that was involved on the inside of the case\" saw Rich's computer and the case file.\n\nWheeler told host Sean Hannity the investigator \"came across [as] very credible. When you look at that, with the totality of everything else that I found in this case, it\u2019s very consistent for a person with my experience to begin to think, 'Well, perhaps there were some email communication between Seth and Wikileaks.'\"\n\nBut a spokesman for Rich's family on Tuesday said Wheeler was not authorized to speak for the family and called assertions Seth Rich sent emails to WikiLeaks \"unsubstantiated.\" Brad Bauman said even if purported emails were to surface, it would not necessarily mean Rich had helped WikiLeaks.\n\n\"Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so,\" Bauman said. \"We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers.\"\n\nAlthough Bauman said Wheeler was paid by a third party, the family is named as clients of Wheeler's Capitol Investigations on a contract signed by Rich's father, Joel Rich.\n\nThe family has been sensitive to speculation that Rich could have leaked emails damaging to the DNC since he was murdered during the height of the presidential campaign in a case that remains unsolved. Wheeler and the federal investigator insist that there is evidence to back their claims.\n\nAn FBI forensic report of Rich's computer -- generated within 96 hours after Rich's murder -- showed he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time, the federal source told Fox News.\n\n\u201cI have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,\u201d the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.\n\nThe revelation is consistent with the findings of Wheeler, whose private investigation firm was hired by a third party on behalf of Rich\u2019s family to probe the case.\n\n\u201cMy investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cI do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters.\u201d\n\nThe federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.\n\nOn July 22, just 12 days after Rich was killed, WikiLeaks published internal DNC emails that appeared to show top party officials conspired to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont from becoming the party\u2019s presidential nominee. That controversy resulted in Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigning as DNC chairperson.\n\nWikiLeaks leader Julian Assange has stopped short of identifying Rich as the source of the emails, but has taken a keen interest in the case, and has not denied working with Rich.\n\n\u201cWikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich,\u201d the organization announced.\n\nAssange has not returned a series of recent emails from Fox News about Rich. MacFadyen, who was considered a mentor by Assange, died of lung cancer on Oct. 22 at age 76.\n\nWashington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department has no suspects and no substantial leads as to who the killer or killers may be, sources close to the investigation said. Metropolitan Police, including the police chief, have refused to discuss the case, despite requests from Fox News dating back 10 months.\n\nThe department released a statement on the case saying it remains an active investigation and that detectives are working with Rich's family.\n\n\"If there are any individuals who feel they have information, we urge them to call us at (202) 727-9099 or text us at 50411,\" read the statement. \"The department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information on this case that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.\"\n\nThe FBI\u2019s national office declined to comment, but sources said the bureau provided cyber expertise to examine Rich\u2019s computer.\n\nD.C. police have announced a $25,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Rich\u2019s killer. Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman has offered a separate $130,000 reward.","The life of Seth Rich, a 27-year-old Democratic National Committee staffer, ended nearly a year ago when he was shot to death near his house in Washington, DC. Then came the tragic and bizarre afterlife: Since July, Rich has been the focus of intense right-wing conspiracy theories that have only escalated as the Trump administration\u2019s scandals have deepened.\n\nAs the police have repeatedly stated, there is no evidence that Rich\u2019s death was anything other than the consequence of a botched robbery. But some people, especially on the right, believe Rich was murdered by the Clintons for knowing too much about something. The most recent theories claim that Rich, not the Russians, was responsible for leaking the emails, published in WikiLeaks, that revealed Democratic party leaders had talked disparagingly about Bernie Sanders.\n\nThanks to an erroneous Fox News story last week, which was finally retracted on Tuesday, Rich recently became the focus of an intense media blitz from conservative outlets \u2014 many of which were eager for something to talk about besides the scandals swirling around Donald Trump.\n\nFox News\u2019s Sean Hannity was one of the most enthusiastic rumormongers, devoting segments on three separate occasions last week to Rich. Even after Fox News retracted its story, Hannity promised he would continue to investigate. \u201cI retracted nothing,\u201d he said defiantly on his radio show Tuesday.\n\nRich\u2019s family has been begging right-wing news outlets to stop spreading unfounded rumors about him, but by now the situation seems to have gotten out of control.\n\nIn death, Rich has become a martyr to the right, buoyed by a host of characters each with their own ulterior motives: There is WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who wants to downplay the connections between WikiLeaks and the Russians; there are the Clinton haters, who want to spread the idea that the Clintons are murderers; there are the Trump supporters, who want to minimize the idea that Russian hackers helped deliver the election to their candidate; and there are the talking heads on Fox News, who last week needed something other than negative Trump stories to make conversation about.\n\nWe might not know who killed Seth Rich, but we do know who turned his legacy into a textbook study of where fake news comes from, how it spreads, and the victims it creates.\n\nSeth Rich was murdered in a senseless act of violence\nSeth Rich worked in Democratic politics for most of his career. He grew up and went to college in Omaha, Nebraska, where as a student he volunteered on two Democratic Senate campaigns. After graduating, he moved to Washington, DC, for a job at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a progressive opinion research and consulting firm. He was later hired by the Democratic National Committee, where he worked on a project to help people find where to vote.\n\nOn Sunday, July 10, Rich was shot to death about a block from where he lived in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of DC. Gunshot detection microphones place the time of the shooting at around 4:20 am. Rich had last been seen at around 1:30 am leaving Lou\u2019s City Bar in Columbia Heights, about a 40-minute walk from where he lived.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what happened during those three intervening hours. The Washington Post reported that, according to his parents, cellphone records show that Rich called his girlfriend at 2:05 am and talked to her for more than two hours. He hung up just minutes before he was shot.\n\nThe police found Rich on the sidewalk with multiple gunshot wounds, at least two in the back. He still had his watch, his cellphone, and his wallet. There were signs of a struggle: bruises on his hands, knees, and face, and a torn wristwatch strap. According to the police report, he was still \u201cconscious and breathing.\u201d Family members say they were told that Rich was \u201cvery talkative,\u201d though it is not publicly known if he was able to describe his assailant or assailants. Rich died a few hours later in the hospital.\n\nThe police suspected Rich had been the victim of an attempted robbery. Bloomingdale is a gentrifying part of Washington that still suffers from violent crime. In 2016, there were 24 reported robberies with a gun that occurred within a quarter-mile of the street corner where Rich was shot.\n\nThe first conspiracy theories grew out of the \u201cClinton body count\u201d rumor\nAlmost immediately after news of Rich\u2019s death, conspiracy theories began circulating on social media. A few factors helped make Rich a target of speculation:\n\nThe murderers left behind Rich\u2019s valuables. (Though, by that same paranoid logic, wouldn\u2019t a professional hitman have taken Rich\u2019s wallet and phone in order to make it look like a regular mugging?)\nRich worked at the DNC, where in December there had been a minor scandal involving a software glitch that allowed the Bernie Sanders campaign to access private voter data collected by the Clinton campaign.\nHillary Clinton had just clinched the nomination after a surprisingly bruising primary, and there were still sore feelings in the air.\nThere\u2019s a long-running conspiracy theory that the Clintons have assassinated dozens of their political enemies.\nIf those facts don\u2019t seem to add up to a coherent story, well, you\u2019re thinking too hard. Conspiracy theories don\u2019t operate logically. They start from an assumption \u2014 for instance, \u201cthe Clintons are shady\u201d \u2014 and spiral outward in search of corroboration.\n\nOn Reddit, for instance, one user wrote a 1,400-word post listing things that he found \u201csuspicious.\u201d Here were some of the stray facts the redditor claimed were evidence of a hit job by the DNC or the Clintons:\n\nRich\u2019s former employer, Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, once did some consulting work for British Petroleum. (\u201cIs it possible that Mr. Rich was aware of the public's disdain for oil industry/fracking?\u201d)\nRich once worked on Ben Nelson\u2019s campaign for senator. (\u201c[Nelson] contributed a crucial vote to help pass Obamacare back in 2009.\u201d)\nThe political conventions were coming up. (\u201cThe TIMING of this tragedy seems too 'coincidental\u2019\u201d)\nIt\u2019s unclear what any of these facts have to do with the Clintons, but somehow the Reddit user concluded: \u201cgiven his position &amp; timing in politics, I believe Seth Rich was murdered by corrupt politicians for knowing too much information on election fraud.\u201d\n\nOthers on Twitter and the trolling website 4chan also speculated that Rich might have crossed the Clintons in some way. Rich\u2019s death seemed to fit in with the \u201cClinton body count\u201d theory, which dates to the 1990s and claims that the Clintons are so vindictive that they hire hitmen to murder people they don\u2019t like.\n\nPeople who believe the Clintons are murderers often point to deputy White House counsel Vince Foster, who suffered from clinical depression and died of a gunshot wound to the mouth in 1993. Several investigations all ruled Foster\u2019s death a suicide, but some conservatives insisted there must have been foul play. They claimed that Foster, who was looking into the Clintons\u2019 taxes, may have uncovered evidence of corruption in connection to the Whitewater controversy, a guilt-by-association scandal involving friends of the Clintons\u2019.\n\nThe \u201cClinton body count\u201d theory has endured over the years simply because people don\u2019t live forever. Any time someone dies who was connected to the Clintons \u2014 and since Bill Clinton was the president of the United States, literally thousands of people were in his orbit \u2014 this theory is dredged up again by the tinfoil hat crowd. And then it slowly fades.\n\nAt first it seemed the speculation about Seth Rich would die down quickly as well. But then 12 days later, on July 22, WikiLeaks published thousands of private emails from the DNC, and Rich became a politically useful distraction.\n\nJulian Assange and WikiLeaks supercharged the Seth Rich rumors\nA month before Rich was murdered, the DNC admitted that Russian hackers had broken into its computer network, gaining access to all of the DNC\u2019s emails. The thought of Russian interference in American politics was infuriating to Rich, according to one person \u201cwho was very close\u201d to him, the Washington Post reported: \u201cIt was crazy. Especially for Seth. He said, \u2018Oh, my God. We have a foreign entity trying to get involved in our elections?\u2019 That made him so angry.\u201d\n\nWhen WikiLeaks released its dump of DNC emails on July 22, the obvious explanation was that it had obtained those emails from the Russian hackers. This connection was later confirmed by top US intelligence agencies, who concluded \u201cwith high confidence\u201d that DNC servers were hacked by top Russian government hackers, who had then given the emails to WikiLeaks. \u201cMoscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity,\u201d the US intelligence report explained, as well as for its connection to the Russian propaganda outlet Russia Today.\n\nBut WikiLeaks has repeatedly denied its ties to Russia, and ever since last summer it has used Seth Rich as a way to distract from claims that it abetted Russian interference in the US election. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had his own reasons to fear a Clinton presidency \u2014 as secretary of state, Clinton wanted to indict Assange for his involvement in releasing the millions of US diplomatic cables leaked by Chelsea Manning.\n\nOn Dutch television in August 2016, Assange hinted that Rich, not Russia, may have been the source for the WikiLeaks emails. \"Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material, and often very significant risks,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a 27-year-old, works for the DNC, was shot in the back, murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.\"\n\n\n\u201cWas he one of your sources then?\u201d the anchor asked.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t comment on who our sources are,\u201d Assange replied.\n\n\u201cThen why make the suggestion about a young guy being shot in the streets of Washington?\u201d the anchor replied.\n\nPressed repeatedly for clarification, Assange concluded that \u201cothers, others have suggested that. We\u2019re investigating to understand what happened in that situation with Seth Rich. I think it\u2019s a concerning situation; there\u2019s not a conclusion yet.\u201d\n\nAs part of its \u201cinvestigation,\u201d WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 prize in August for information about Rich\u2019s murder.\n\nThis is the point where Seth Rich became a prop in a game of international espionage.\n\nTrump supporters and the alt-right amplified the theory that Rich was some kind of Democratic whistleblower or leaker, even though the facts didn\u2019t really fit this pattern. He didn\u2019t have access to the DNC emails, and he had never shown any prowess at hacking \u2014 being a data analyst involves a very different set of skills. Besides, the DNC wasn\u2019t the only organization that was hacked: Clinton campaign chair John Podesta\u2019s personal emails, for instance, were stolen separately, as were the emails at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nNevertheless, many on the right were inspired by the WikiLeaks insinuations and started to concoct their own conspiracy theories about Rich\u2019s murder. In August, former House speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich told a conservative talk show host that Rich\u2019s death was suspicious. \u201cFirst of all, of course it\u2019s worth talking about,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if Assange says he is the source, Assange may know. That\u2019s not complicated.\u201d\n\nThat same month, Trump adviser Roger Stone claimed, without evidence, that Rich was murdered \u201con his way to meet with the FBI to discuss election fraud.\u201d\n\nTo Trump supporters, the claim that Rich had been murdered by the Clintons had twofold appeal: It reinforced the rumor that the Clintons were shady operatives, and it distracted from the mounting evidence that Russia had interfered with the US election \u2014 possibly in collusion with the Trump campaign.\n\nIn the presidential debate on September 26, Trump famously suggested that it could have been a lone hacker who was responsible for the stolen DNC emails. \"It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds,\" he said.\n\nThanks to a weird miscommunication, the conspiracy theory comes back in May\nAfter the election, the conspiracy theories about Seth Rich faded from public consciousness, as the focus turned instead to the FBI\u2019s investigation of connections between Trump staffers and Russian agents. Suspicions still bubbled in right-wing corners of Reddit and on alt-right websites like Gateway Pundit, and Assange continued to claim that it wasn\u2019t the Russians who provided the hacked emails \u2014 but most of America had moved on.\n\nBut Rich returned to the news last week, when the local TV station FOX 5 DC aired an interview with private investigator Rod Wheeler, who claimed that sources in the FBI told him there was evidence of a connection between Rich and WikiLeaks:\n\nFOX 5 DC: You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...\n\nWHEELER: For sure...\n\nFOX 5 DC: ...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?\n\nWHEELER: Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.\nConservative media outlets jumped on the story, which aired the night of Monday, May 15. By Tuesday morning, conservative outlets like Breitbart, the Blaze, and the Daily Caller all had their own pieces relaying Wheeler\u2019s claims.\n\nOn Tuesday, Fox News added its own revelation: It claimed that an unnamed \u201cfederal investigator\u201d had confirmed that Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks. \u201cI have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,\u201d the source said, according to Fox News. Fox News additionally claimed this source had evidence that Rich had given thousands of DNC emails to WikiLeaks.\n\nThis was a two-source story: The report also said that Wheeler had independently corroborated what the anonymous \u201cfederal investigator\u201d had told Fox News.\n\nBut here\u2019s where it gets confusing. By Tuesday afternoon, Wheeler told CNN that he had misspoken. It turns out he didn\u2019t have any evidence of his own.\n\nWhat had happened, apparently, was that earlier in the week, Fox News had contacted Wheeler for its own story on Rich. That was when Wheeler learned that Fox News had a source alleging there was contact between Rich and WikiLeaks. When Wheeler went on local TV on Monday night to talk about Rich, he believed he was giving viewers a \u201cpreview\u201d of the Fox News story set to run on Tuesday.\n\nThat, at least, is how Wheeler explained the situation to CNN last Tuesday. Somehow, through miscommunication or sloppy reporting, the Fox News report used Wheeler to back up its claims about the Rich-WikiLeaks connection. This was incorrect, Wheeler said. He had no independent knowledge.\n\n\"I only got that [information] from the reporter at Fox News,\" he told CNN.\n\nYesterday, after leaving it up for a week, Fox News finally retracted its Seth Rich story, which was down to one anonymous source. \u201cThe article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting,\u201d an editor\u2019s note explained. \u201cUpon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.\u201d\n\nConservative media has a field day\nIt\u2019s unlikely that any of this would have been a big deal had there not been a stunning series of damaging reports about Donald Trump last week.\n\nAmong other things, it was revealed that Trump had shared state secrets with the Russians, that he had pressured FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation into ties between Trump affiliates and Russia, and that the Russia probe had reached a current high-level White House official, who many suspect is Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nOne way the conservative media minimized all the bad news was to focus on other stories. The latest Seth Rich allegations became a welcome distraction from the constant revelations coming out of the Washington Post and the New York Times.\n\nFor instance, while most outlets were covering the revelation that Trump had volunteered classified information to Russians, the alt-right website Breitbart devoted its front page to the Seth Rich conspiracy. Breitbart even slammed the mainstream media for ignoring the rumors about Rich: \u201cSilence from Establishment Media over Seth Rich WikiLeaks Report\u201d was the title of one story.\n\nFox News in particular devoted outsize attention to the Rich story, repeatedly rehashing the conspiracy theory. On his 10 pm show, Fox pundit Sean Hannity devoted segments to Rich on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday last week. \u201cI'm not backing off asking questions even though there is an effort that nobody talk about Seth Rich,\u201d he said on Friday night.\n\nOn Tuesday, even after Fox News retracted the story that ignited the latest round of speculation, Hannity remained convinced that the Seth Rich conspiracy theory had legs. \u201cI am not Fox.com or FoxNews.com,\u201d he said on his radio show. \u201cI retracted nothing.\u201d\n\nLater that evening, on his television show, Hannity said that for now, he would stop talking about Rich \u201cout of respect for the family's wishes.\u201d On Twitter, though, he was defiant, claiming that \u201cliberal fascism\u201d was trying to silence his voice.\n\n\u201cOk TO BE CLEAR, I am closer to the TRUTH than ever,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cNot only am I not stopping, I am working harder.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease retweet,\u201d he added.\n\nRich was an unlucky victim of the conservative media\nThe recent attention has reignited the old Seth Rich conspiracy theories, bringing forth even more unsubstantiated claims.\n\nOn Fox News\u2019s Sunday morning talk show, Newt Gingrich repeated his belief that Rich, not Russia, was responsible for the DNC hack. \u201cIt turns out, it wasn\u2019t the Russians,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was this young guy who, I suspect, was disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Assange issued a cryptic tweet using the hashtag \u201c#SethRich\u201d which fanned the flames even further: \u201cWikiLeaks has never disclosed a source. Sources sometimes talk to other parties but identities never emerge from WikiLeaks. #SethRich.\u201d\n\nAnd on Tuesday, New Zealand file-sharing entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, who is wanted by the US government for copyright infringement and racketeering, claimed that Rich had personally contacted him in 2014, and that the two had talked about \u201ca number of topics including corruption and the influence of corporate money in politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that Seth Rich was involved in the DNC leak,\u201d Dotcom wrote in a statement.\n\nRich\u2019s family has repeatedly asked news outlets to stop publicizing these rumors. \u201cThose theories, which some reporters have since retracted, are baseless, and they are unspeakably cruel,\u201d Mary and Joel Rich wrote in a Washington Post op-ed on Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cImagine that instead, every call that comes in is a reporter asking what you think of a series of lies or conspiracies about the death,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThat nightmare is what our family goes through every day.\u201d\n\nThe Riches also pushed back on some of the rumors themselves, stating that the FBI had found no evidence of communication between their son and WikiLeaks, and that Seth had no access to any of the DNC emails that were leaked:\n\nDespite these facts, our family\u2019s nightmare persists. Seth\u2019s death has been turned into a political football. Every day we wake up to new headlines, new lies, new factual errors, new people approaching us to take advantage of us and Seth\u2019s legacy. It just won\u2019t stop. The amount of pain and anguish this has caused us is unbearable. With every conspiratorial flare-up, we are forced to relive Seth\u2019s murder and a small piece of us dies as more of Seth\u2019s memory is torn away from us.\nBut to conspiracy theorists, the facts have never mattered. Fake news always has ulterior motives, and everybody who amplified the Seth Rich conspiracy theories had their own stake in keeping the lies alive.","In January, a group of Cornell University undergraduates travelled to the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam, a region of the world considered to be one of the most vulnerable to climate change. There they met with farmers, climate experts, government officials and their peers and learned about the ominous changes taking place in the Mekong that, ultimately, will impact us all.\n\nThe trip was part of course intended to help millennials better appreciate the interconnected and interdependent world they live in and to fully grasp what is ahead for Vietnam and for them \u2013 a grand challenge, on a grand scale. About the time these students turn 50, sea-level rise will have displaced an estimated million residents of the Mekong Delta.\n\n\nBy 2100 much of the region will likely be underwater, affecting millions more. To say nothing about the impacts on major American cities, including Miami Beach, Boston and New York that, like the Mekong, have considerable real estate at risk from rising sea levels.\n\n\nChanges caused by rising sea levels are already flooding into the Mekong Delta, especially in the rural areas where Vietnam grows much of its food. Our group of Cornell students learned that rains now fall during what was once the dry season, interfering with seed set and reducing rice yields.\n\nIncreasing salt-water intrusion is forcing farmers to abandon rice altogether and switch to more salt-tolerant options such as shrimp production and crops such as coconut and watermelons. More groundwater is being used to dilute salty water for irrigation and drinking, which in turn results in land subsidence and exacerbated saltwater intrusion.\n\nFrom this two-week journey to a country 8,000 miles from home and at the forefront of our greatest global challenge, the students gathered stories to tell and share with the world \u2013 because what is happening in Vietnam will be repeated globally.\n\nOne of the first things the students learned was that climate change is accepted as fact in Vietnam; it is not politicized, and is discussed freely. Messages to take home, \u201cThe Vietnamese people do not avoid talking about the changing climate; it\u2019s happening in their own backyard,\u201d said Conor McCabe, an animal science major, class of \u201818. \u201cClimate change is definitely an uncomfortable topic since it has so many ramifications for society and the livelihoods of everyday people. Taking part in that difficult discussion, rather than shying away, is what I plan to do from now on,\u201d said Becky Cardinali, an economics major, class of \u201919.\n\nThese millennials also learned that despite the history of the Vietnam War and the role the U.S. now plays in exacerbating climate change, the Vietnamese people were extraordinarily welcoming: \u201cI felt so embarrassed that I had contributed to the climate change that was destroying their livelihoods. How did they repay me?  By inviting me into their homes for tea. They did not hate us, in fact they were extremely welcoming, hopeful and forward looking,\u201d said Marc Alessi an up-and-coming meteorologist, class of \u201818.\n\nOne of the more salient moments during their visit occurred when students heard a Vietnamese government official explain that the evidence for climate change and its cause is well established, and for them, it is not a hoax. As the students observed, climate change is not a hoax for the rest of the world, nor is it a distant, future threat: \u201cMy time in the Mekong Delta served as a reminder that, for many, climate change is immediate,\u201d said Gail Fletcher, majoring in history and government, class of \u201917.\n\nIn 2016 the United States and Vietnam, along with nearly every other country on the planet, signed the Paris Agreement on climate change committing them all to a goal of keeping temperature rise to below 20C, maybe 1.5. Eerily, the Peace Accords that ended the longest war in American history were also signed in Paris. A war that cost the lives of 58,000 U.S. troops, many the same age as today\u2019s Cornell students.\n\n\u201cSetting all other issues aside, the Paris Agreement must be backed by all signatories. The bond that can heal troubled relationships between countries can be a shared concern for the future of this planet.\n\nOtherwise, as Earth continues to warm and food becomes more scarce, driving up prices, tensions among countries are only going to rise and result in more conflict, more wars. Regardless of your personal, religious or cultural beliefs, the Earth is going to keep on warming. And it is already happening in real life and is impacting real people. Ladies and gentlemen, it is 2017: time to wake up,\u201d added Jeff Fralick, environmental science and sustainability major, class of \u201918.\n\nClimate change is not a hoax to these millennials, members of one of the largest voter-eligible blocks in the U.S. \u2014 nearly 1 in 3. It is deadly serious and an issue that just might arouse this sleeping giant. It is their future and yours.","The basic science behind climate change is actually quite simple.\n\nThe story began nearly 150 years ago when Irish physicist John Tyndall discovered \u2018carbonic acid\u2019 \u2013 today known as carbon dioxide \u2013 was one of a number of \u201cperfectly colourless and invisible gases and vapours\u201d to absorb radiant heat.\n\nHe also realised just how important this was to life on Earth as without such gases it would be \u201cheld fast in the iron grip of frost\u201d.\n\nAbout 40 years later, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first suggested that increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would cause the global temperature to go up, particularly in the Arctic. But the idea remained mostly an academic question until, as he predicted, the mercury started to rise.\n\nThis is one of the certainties in climate science \u2013 the world has got warmer.\n\nHow do we know that the world has really warmed up?\n\nLast year, the hottest on record for the third year in a row, was about 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, according to Nasa and the Met Office, boosted slightly by the natural El Nino effect. Svalbard in the Arctic has seen average winter temperatures rise by up to a staggering 11C compared to the average between 1961 and 1990.\n\nIn addition to thermometer records going back to the 1880s, there is a large amount of natural evidence in the form of glaciers retreating and sea ice melting to record lows, sea levels rising by 20cm, islands disappearing, animals and plants shifting their ranges and spring coming several weeks earlier.\n\nIronically, the famously impassable Northwest Passage \u2013 which claimed the lives of numerous explorers trying to find a new trade route to China \u2013 is now so free of ice that people can take a cruise through it on a ship powered by the fossil fuels that help cause global warming.\n\nIt is also certain that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased and that human activity is responsible for this. Helpfully, atmospheric carbon dioxide resulting from fossil fuels has a different isotope signature to the gas produced naturally.\n\nAs Nasa puts it: \u201cThere is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.\u201d\n\nHow do we know that warming has anything to do with humans?\n\nAll this does not scientifically prove beyond all doubt that our greenhouse gases, which also include water vapour, nitrous oxide, ozone and methane, are causing global warming.\n\nBut the correlation between the two and the evidence of causation first supplied by Tyndall make a compelling argument. It is as near to certain as it is possible to get without conducting a planet-scale experiment.\n\nOutside of conspiracy theorists, cranks and some of the ruling US politicians, no one disputes the above is true. Even the UK\u2019s leading \u2018sceptic\u2019 think tank, Nigel Lawson\u2019s Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), agrees.\n\nWhat will happen in the future?\n\nSome commentators, including the GWPF, adopt a so-called \u2018lukewarmist\u2019 position, arguing that climate change will not be too bad so there is no need to stop using fossil fuels. They point to beneficial effects such as 'global greening' in which plant growth is boosted by the extra carbon in the air.\n\nOthers have claimed humanity is plunging headlong towards catastrophe and possibly even a future in which a tiny band of survivors cluster around the last remaining habitable territory near the poles.\n\nBoth groups are at odds with the science.\n\nAs Professor Tim Palmer, an Oxford University physicist who has worked on reports for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), explained in a recent talk at the Royal Society, the \u2018scientific consensus\u2019 on climate change is that it could be anything between those two extremes.\n\nAccording to computer models, developed using mathematics, the laws of physics and the best available knowledge, the world could be on course for between about 1.5C and more than 5C of warming as a result of the doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. So far it has risen from about 280 parts per million \u2013 a level that had remained fairly constant from the end of the last Ice Age to the 1800s \u2013 to more than 400ppm today.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about scientific consensus, I would say it\u2019s basically about this [temperature] distribution, it\u2019s not individual predictions,\u201d Professor Palmer told the Royal Society.\n\nBut, according to the models, there is a much higher probability of going beyond 2C of warming, than staying below this point, often regarded as when climate change becomes particularly \u2018dangerous\u2019.\n\nAnd, as Professor Palmer also pointed out, there is also \u201ca non-negligible probability of 5C or more, which would be utterly catastrophic\u201d.\n\nModels are often the source of derision from climate \u2018sceptics\u2019 or \u2018deniers\u2019, but they have actually proved remarkably successful when measured against actual observations. Even Arrhenius\u2019 prediction that the Arctic would warm more quickly has proved to be true.","With Hurricane Matthew wreaking havoc, the Left is predictably seizing the storm as a means of promoting their radical global warming agenda. Climate change has not been a major theme this election cycle, but Hillary Clinton is now trying to turn it into one, with the help of global warming guru Al Gore. Unfortunately for the climate change alarmists, despite all the celebrity endorsements and high-minded rhetoric, the facts keep getting in the way. Here are nine things you need to know about the climate change hoax.\n\n1. The Climategate scandal proved that key data involving man-made climate change was manipulated. In 2009, the public discovered emails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit exposing how scientists who have been enormously influential in promoting the concept of man-made climate change actually attempted to cook the books to obtain results that served their narrative that the planet was heating at a dangerous trend due to higher levels of carbon dioxide.\n\nOne of these scientists included Dr. James Hansen, a former NASA climatologist who is known by some as the \"father\" or \"grandfather\" of the climate change myth, as it was his \"Model Zero\" that first introduced the concept of global warming. Hansen, Philip Jones, Michael Mann, et al. were all involved in trying \"to lower past temperatures and to 'adjust' recent temperatures upwards, in order to convey the impression of an accelerated warming,\" according to the leaked emails. The emails also revealed how this cabal of scientists would discuss various ways to stonewall the public from seeing the \"background data on which their findings and temperature records were based,\" even going as far as deleting significant amounts of data. They would engage in efforts to smear \"any scientific journal which dares to publish their critics' work.\"\n\n2. The Climategate scandal was given new life in 2011, with the release of new emails. The new round of leaked emails at the time provided more teeth to the revelations of 2009. Here are a couple of egregious emails from Jones found, via Forbes:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told that IPCC is above national FOI [Freedom of Information] Acts. One way to cover yourself and all those working in AR5 would be to delete all emails at the end of the process,\u201d writes Phil Jones, a scientist working with the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in a newly released email.\n\n\u201cAny work we have done in the past is done on the back of the research grants we get \u2013 and has to be well hidden,\u201d Jones writes in another newly released email. \u201cI\u2019ve discussed this with the main funder (U.S. Dept of Energy) in the past and they are happy about not releasing the original station data.\u201d\n\nAn email written by Mann showed that he tried to get \"an investigative journalist to investigate and expose\" a climate skeptic scientist named Steven McIntyre.\n\n3. NASA may have also been involved in manipulating data to serve the narrative of man-made climate change. The Washington Times reported in 2009: \"Under pressure in 2007, NASA recalculated its data and found that 1934, not 1998, was the hottest year in its records for the contiguous 48 states. NASA later changed that data again, and now 1998 and 2006 are tied for first, with 1934 slightly cooler.\"\n\nSince this occurred at around the same time as the Climategate scandal, Chris Horner of the Competitive Enterprise Institute filed a lawsuit to get NASA to release their relevant data sets on this issue and was able to expose emails from NASA that revealed a disturbing fact: the agency admitted \"that its own climate findings were inferior to those maintained by both the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit,\" reported Fox News in 2010 \u2013 meaning NASA climate change data sets were less accurate than the organization embattled with manipulating data sets.\n\nA 2015 Washington Times editorial also highlighted another example of NASA cooking the books:\n\nPaul Homewood, a skeptical researcher, found that in Paraguay, temperature readings for the 20th century at all nine weather stations supervised by NASA had been \u201cadjusted\u201d to transform a cooling trend into a warming trend. His analysis of readings in the Arctic found that rapid warming between 1920 and 1950 \u2014 before human activity could have increased the production of greenhouse gases \u2014 were adjusted downward so that the 1980s and \u201890s temperatures would stand out as warmer.\n\n4. NASA also declared 2014 to be the hottest year on record \u2013 despite the fact that they were only 38 percent sure about it. The latter fact was left out of their press release at the time, as well as the fact that 2014 was supposedly hotter than the previous hottest year, 2010, by 0.02C \u2013 well within the margin of error of 0.1C that scientists tend to adhere by. The Washington Post attempted to spin in favor of NASA by arguing that NASA simply said that 2014 was the most likely hottest year on record \u2013 but their press release unequivocally stated that \"2014 was the warmest year on record\" and leaving out the aforementioned key facts makes such a declaration seem misleading, as it's clearly not a guarantee that 2014 was even likely the hottest year on record.\n\n5. There is no evidence that the Earth has been warming in recent years. As The Daily Caller highlights, a recent peer-reviewed study concluded that when accounting for El Ninos and La Ninas \u2013 which are the \"the fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the east-central Equatorial Pacific\" that \"occur on average every two to seven years,\" according to NOAA \u2013 there has been a flat-line temperature trend since 1997. In fact, the study found that the El Ninos and La Ninas disproved the existence of the Tropical Hot Spot, which the Environmental Protection Agency claimed as evidence of carbon dioxide supposedly warming the atmosphere.\n\n6. The left likes to claim that 97 percent of scientists support the concept of man-made climate change. It's likely closer to 43 percent. The 97 percent myth stems from a variety of flawed studies, as the Daily Wire explained here. On the other hand, the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency conducted a survey in 2015 that found that only 43 percent of scientists believe in man-made climate change, which is far from a consensus.\n\n7. The amount of Arctic sea ice has become quite high. Data from the Danish Meteorological Institute shows that the \"average [ice] extent over the month [of September] is one of the highest in the last decade,\" according to Paul Homewood. This runs directly counter to the predictions of the climate change models.\n\n8. Money from the federal government and leftist organizations fuel a lot of misinformation from man-made global warming alarmists.  Climate change alarmism is an extremely lucrative industry. All in all, there have been over $32.5 billion of federal government grants that have funded climate change research from 1989-2009, far more than any research funded by the oil industry. National Review reports:\n\nLast summer, a minority staff report from the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works gave details on a \u201cBillionaire\u2019s Club\u201d \u2014 a shadowy network of charitable foundations that distribute billions to advance climate alarmism. Shadowy nonprofits such as the Energy Foundation and Tides Foundation distributed billions to far-left green groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, which in turn send staff to the EPA who then direct federal grants back to the same green groups. It is incestuous. It is opaque. Major media ignored the report.\n\nMann, one of the scientists mentioned earlier for his role in the Climategate scandal, received nearly $6 million in grants from the federal government. The sources of funding for scientists like Hansen are unknown, the federal government has been resisting Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to reveal them.\n\n9. It is patently absurd to link Hurricane Matthew to climate change. Not just because of the aforementioned reasons, but because as Marco Morano points out at Climate Depot, \"The data show for the last 10 years we have had an unusual drought of landfalling major hurricanes (Category 3 and higher) on the continental U.S.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s right, no major hurricanes have made landfall for over a decade,\" Morano continued. \"This is the longest such drought on record.\"","One of the main lines of evidence used by the Obama administration to justify its global warming regulations doesn\u2019t exist in the real world, according to a new report by climate researchers.\n\nResearchers analyzed temperature observations from satellites, weather balloons, weather stations and buoys and found the so-called \u201ctropical hotspot\u201d relied upon by the EPA to declare carbon dioxide a pollutant \u201csimply does not exist in the real world.\u201d\n\nThey found that once El Ninos are taken into account, \u201cthere is no \u2018record setting\u2019 warming to be concerned about.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese analysis results would appear to leave very, very little doubt but that EPA\u2019s claim of a Tropical Hot Spot (THS), caused by rising atmospheric CO2 levels, simply does not exist in the real world,\u201d reads the report by economist James Wallace, climatologist John Christy and meteorologist Joseph D\u2019Aleo.\n\n\u201cAlso critically important, even on an all-other-things-equal basis, this analysis failed to find that the steadily rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations have had a statistically significant impact on any of the 13 critically important temperature time series analyzed,\u201d they wrote.\n\nWhen EPA released its CO2 endangerment finding in 2009, it used three lines of evidence to bolster its argument that greenhouse gases threatened human health through global warming.\nThe crux of EPA\u2019s argument rested on the existence of a \u201ctropical hotspot\u201d where global warming would be most apparent. That is, there should be enhanced warming in the tropical troposphere \u2014 the \u201cfingerprint\u201d of global warming.\n\nEPA\u2019s endangerment finding is the legal basis for agency global warming regulations, including the Clean Power Plan (CPP) now being fought over in federal court. CPP aims to cut power plant carbon dioxide emissions 32 percent by 2030 and could cost $41 billion a year, according to independent estimates.\n\nD\u2019Aleo and his colleagues looked at the data and controlled for El Ninos and La Ninas. What they found was that once natural oceanic warming and cooling events are accounted for, there\u2019s no warming trend.\n\n\u201cEl Nino is not by any means new,\u201d D\u2019Aleo told The Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cThe El Ninos and La Ninas do not occur at a regular frequency but tend to cluster as we showed in our paper.\u201d\n\nTropospheric temperatures are mainly measured by satellites and weather balloons, which collect data from the lowest few miles of the atmosphere. Satellites already show only slight warming since 1979, but they are sensitive to El Ninos and La Ninas.\n\nRemoving El Ninos and La Ninas from tropospheric temperatures creates \u201ctemperature time series each having a flat trend.\u201d Basically, D\u2019Aleo and his colleagues found oceanic warming events are responsible for virtually all the warming since 1977 when El Ninos became more frequent and stronger.\n\nOn the flip side, the recent \u201chiatus\u201d in global warming can be explained by more frequent La Ninas, according to D\u2019Aleo.\n\n\u201cIt is an accepted fact that El Ninos bring global warmth and La Ninas cooling,\u201d D\u2019Aleo said. \u201cIt is thus not at all surprising that the period from 1947 to 1977 brought cooling, 1977 to 1997 warming and we had a flat trend from 1997 to current.\u201d\n\nWith El Ninos and La Ninas adjusted out of the data, only volcanoes are left \u2014 base on EPA assumptions \u2014 to impact the climate, and D\u2019Aleo\u2019s report acknowledges \u201cit was still possible that the volcanic activity was hiding CO2\u2019s impact.\u201d\n\nVolcanic aerosols can have a cooling effect on global average temperature; the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo caused a dip in satellite temperature data that lasted for a couple years.\n\n\u201cThe temperature data measurements that were analyzed were taken by many different entities using balloons, satellites, buoys and various land based techniques,\u201d reads the report. \u201cNeedless to say, if regardless of data source, the results are the same, the analysis findings should be considered highly credible.\u201d\n\nClimate scientists have been debating for years over the existence of the \u201ctropical hotspot.\u201d\n\nChristy, who co-runs the premier satellite temperature dataset at the University of Alabama in Huntsville with climatologist Roy Spencer, has presented evidence that climate models overpredicted warming in the tropical troposphere.\n\nRoss McKitrick, an environmental economist at the University of Guelph in Canada, also ran the numbers and found climate models overestimated warming in the tropical troposphere.\n\nMcKitrick provided evidence of a phase shift in 1977 from dominant El Ninas to El Ninos \u2014 just like D\u2019Aleo, Christy and Williams found.\n\n\u201cOver the 55-years from 1958 to 2012, climate models not only significantly over-predict observed warming in the tropical troposphere, but they represent it in a fundamentally different way than is observed,\u201d McKitrick wrote in a 2014 study.","Climate change is the biggest scam in the history of the world \u2013 a $1.5 trillion-a-year conspiracy against the taxpayer, every cent, penny and centime of which ends in the pockets of the wrong kind of people, none of which goes towards a cause remotely worth funding, all of it a complete and utter waste.\n\nNowhere is this truer in the field of the environment which, I sincerely believe \u2013 and I\u2019ve been doing a lot of research into this \u2013 must count among the biggest wastes of tax money in the history of the world.\n\nLast year Climate Change Business Journal \u2013 calculated that the total annual spend on the climate change industry is $1.5 trillion a year.\n\nAll those carbon traders, climate researchers, renewables and biofuels experts, environment correspondents, professors of climate science at the University of East Anglia and the Potsdam Institute, sustainability officers on local councils, and so on, add up the cost of their grants and salaries \u2013 and $1.5 trillion per year is the ballpark figure you reach.\n\nSo what does $1.5 trillion look like in a global economic context?\n\nWell, it\u2019s roughly the amount we spend every year on the online shopping industry.\n\n$1.5 trillion on the global warming industry; $1.5 trillion on the online shopping industry.\n\nBut there\u2019s a key difference between these two industries.\n\nOne exists to provide buyers and sellers what they want \u2013 to their mutual benefit; the other is a sham.\n\nBuying stuff on the internet: it\u2019s really useful, isn\u2019t it? It has had a dramatically transforming effect on our quality of life, the way you can order a book at 11 o\u2019clock on a Sunday night and have it appear on your doorstep the very next day.\n\nBut how did this marvellous industry spring up? Was it because of all the special incentives and tax breaks granted by wise governments? Nope of course not. They weren\u2019t necessary. The online shopping industry sprung up and grew and grew because it was what people wanted, where they chose \u2013 of their own volition \u2013 to spend their money.\n\nNow compare and contrast the global warming industry \u2013 which I call a Potemkin industry \u2013 because that\u2019s what it is: a fraud; a sham; a conspiracy against the taxpayer.\n\nDo you want to have a guess how much that industry would be worth if it weren\u2019t for all the money funnelled into it via government grants and taxpayer levies and subsidies and regulatory capture?\n\nPretty close to zero, I\u2019d say. Take wind farms \u2013 my hobby horse. The cost of intermittent, unreliable wind energy is roughly twice the market rate for onshore wind; three times the market rate for onshore. Nobody\u2019s going to pay that kind of money in the open market. The only way it\u2019s going to happen if people are mandated by the government to do so: which is what of course has happened across Europe and in the US.\n\nWarren Buffett has said it: \u201cwind farms don\u2019t make sense without the tax credit.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re inefficient; they kill birds and bats; they spoil views; they\u2019re environmentally unfriendly \u2013 rare earth minerals from China; they\u2019re hazardous; they\u2019re expensive; they\u2019re ugly (well I think they are\u2026.)\n\nAnd in few countries is the damage these monstrosities have done more obvious than in Germany, home of the hateful Energiewende.\n\nEnergiewende means Energy Transition. It has been a disaster, as Rupert Darwall noted in a recent Telegraph article.\n\nIn 2004, the Green energy minister, J\u00fcrgen Trittin, claimed that the extra cost of renewable energy on monthly bills was equivalent to the cost of a scoop of ice cream. Nine years later, CDU minister Peter Altmaier said Energiewende could cost around \u20ac1 trillion by the end of the 2030s. The cost of feed-in tariffs and other subsidies is currently \u20ac21.8bn a year; \u20ac20bn is being spent on a new north-south high voltage line and investment in other grid infrastructure is likely to double that number.\n\nThey cause real people real misery.\n\nIn 2013, 345,000 German households could not pay their electricity bills because Energiewende had made them so expensive.\n\nThat\u2019s the financial damage they\u2019ve caused. What about the environmental damage? Here we are in Germany, the Greenest nation on earth. Aren\u2019t Greens supposed to care about animals? Well they don\u2019t about bats, clearly.\n\nBats are special. The reason they\u2019re so heavily protected by so many laws is that they are a K-selected species. That is, they reproduce very slowly, live a long time and are easy to wipe out. Having evolved with few predators \u2013 flying at night helps \u2013 bats did very well with this strategy until the modern world.\n\nBut now we have all those eco-friendly wind turbines. Or as I call them bird-slicing, bat-chomping eco-crucifixes. A recent study in Germany by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research showed that bats killed by German turbines may have come from places 1000 or more miles away. This would suggest that German turbines \u2013 which one study claims kill more than 200,000 bats a year \u2013 may be depressing populations across the entire northeastern portion of Europe.\n\nWhy would anyone put up such things. One reason and one reason only: follow the money.\n\nWhere does the money come from? Us!\n\nWho made the decision to spend that money? Not us.\n\nOh definitely not us. Had it been us we might have done a bit of basic due diligence.\n\nLike, OK, so these wind turbines are necessary you say to save the planet from the threat of catastrophic and unprecedented man-made global warming?\n\nCorrect.\n\nSo has the planet ever been as warm in human history as it is today?\n\nWell, only in the Minoan warming period and the Roman warming period and the Medieval warming period.\n\nJust those. Right. And presumably back then all that CO2 heavy industry was burning was a real problem? No just kidding\u2026Out of interest how much has the planet warmed in the last few years?\n\nAbout 0.8 degrees C since 1850.\n\nRight so since the end of the Little Ice Age (so called because it was characterised by unpleasant cold) and years like the infamous Year Without A Summer (1816), the planet has heated by less than the temperature increase you\u2019d get on a spring day between say breakfast and mid-morning coffee time?\n\nAh yes but the computer models\u2026\n\nIndeed the computer models. Those amazing models which have been predicting catastrophic, runaway warming, when there has been no significant warming since 1998 \u2013 so for eighteen years there has been no global warming?\n\nAh yes but the temperatures of February 2016\u2026.\n\nLook I could go on like this forever. I\u2019ve been listening to these increasingly desperate excuses for decades. Perhaps some of you here believe them \u2013 if so, there\u2019s a bridge I\u2019d like to sell you\u2026\n\nBut it really doesn\u2019t matter whether you believe in global warming or not because here\u2019s the reality:\n\nAll that money we\u2019re being to spend on the global warming industry \u2013 that $1.5 trillion I mentioned earlier siphoned straight out of taxpayers\u2019 pockets \u2013 it isn\u2019t going to make the blindest bit of difference.\n\nNo, I exaggerate. It will make a teeny weeny bit of difference. Bjorn Lomborg has done the calculations. You\u2019re going to love this, if you haven\u2019t heard this before. These figures are just amazing.\n\nSo recently you\u2019ll recall there was a big UN climate conference in Paris COP 21 and all the leaders of the world flew in to save the planet from global warming. But before they turned up, each delegate nation made a voluntary agreement as to how much it was going to cut its carbon emissions. Not compulsory, note. So these countries are free at any stage to abandon their carbon reduction targets \u2013 as funnily enough South Korea did last week. This is how much \u2013 best case scenario \u2013 that various countries are prepared to do to combat climate change.\n\nSo Lomborg added up all the countries INDCs \u2013 that stands for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions \u2013 and worked out, using the climate alarmists\u2019 own models, what effect all this would have on global temperature.\n\nDo you want to know how much? (Oh this is the optimistic scenario by the way, not the pessimistic one).\n\nIf all the countries do their bit then the total reduction in global warming \u2013 by the year 2100 will be 0.170 degrees Centigrade.\n\nAs a climate sceptic friend of mine pointed out at the time, you\u2019d experience a bigger temperature increase than that just walking down from the top to the bottom of the Eiffel tower.\n\nSo there\u2019s your deal folks: you \u2013 and taxpayers like you \u2013 are paying $1.5 trillion a year to reduce the world\u2019s temperatures by the end of this century by 0.170.\n\nIt\u2019s so perfectly ridiculous it\u2019s almost funny.\n\nAnd I suppose on a personal level I shouldn\u2019t complain. I call climate change \u201cthe gift that goes on giving\u201d because day in day out I get an endless stream of stories to write about the corruption, incompetence, skullduggery of the climate alarmism industry.\n\nBut, putting my career aside for the moment, is this really a world we\u2019d like to live in? Can it be right that people who have worked hard for their money should have it taken from them and then wasted in so spectacular fashion?\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the waste that\u2019s so bad it\u2019s worse than that.\n\nIf it were simply a form of taxpayer-funded welfare scheme for otherwise unemployable environmental sciences graduates that would be one thing.\n\nBut this is causing real, lasting harm in any number of ways.\n\nThe corrupting effects on science \u2013 and the scientific method \u2013 which at times are almost redolent of Lysenkoism of the Stalin era.\n\nThe brainwashing of schoolchildren such as you might have found with the Young Pioneers.\n\nThe economic damage caused by the misallocation of resources, as so frequently happens in Communist countries\n\nThe pollution caused by diesel (introduced, on EU recommendation, because it\u2019s supposedly more CO2-friendly) which calls to mind Chernobyl or the poisoning of the Aral Sea.\n\nThe human suffering of those 345,000 German households I mentioned who can\u2019t pay their electricity bills.\n\nDoes this authoritarianism and corruption and incompetence remind you of anything?\n\nWell it has often been said \u2013 and there is much anecdotal evidence to support this \u2013 that after the Berlin Wall came down the left had a bit of a problem. Capitalism had won the economic argument. Where could the left go next?\n\nBut the solution was there waiting them \u2013 the green movement. In the guise of saving the world\u2019s environment they could advance all their usual obsessions \u2013 control, regulation, state intervention, puritanism, compulsory immiseration \u2013 though this time with a smiling, fluffy face. Watermelons they call them: green on the outside, red on the inside.\n\nSo the Berlin Wall came down but it never really went away.\n\nAnd sometimes I look at the world and what has been happening with the rise and rise of green lunacy and I ask myself: did the right side really win the Cold War or is it just an illusion?","Yet more bad news for Obamacare this week: Molina Healthcare lost $110 million on the exchanges last year, and the CEO told investors, \u201cThere are simply too many unknowns with the marketplace program to commit to our participation beyond 2017.\u201d\n\nAt first glance, it\u2019s hard to see why this piece of news is worth worrying about. UnitedHealth recently projected several times those losses, and it's a bigger player on the exchanges. Why spend so much time looking at one modest-size insurer?\n\nBecause Molina is one of the companies that has been repeatedly pointed to, by virtually every health-care-policy wonk in the business, as one of the \u201cbright spots\u201d on the exchanges. Molina is a company that specializes in covering poor people. Before Obamacare, they were a sizable player in the \u201cMedicaid managed care\u201d model, and it seemed like the expertise they\u2019d thusly acquired was allowing them to design the sort of plans that actually made money on the exchanges. Which is to say bare bones plans, not fancy but adequate. Apparently, that\u2019s no longer a money-maker, at least for Molina.\n\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily the pattern we\u2019ve seen with other insurers. Molina seems to have made money until it was forced to pay into a fund designed to transfer money from insurers that ended up with an unusually healthy patient pool, to those who got stuck with the sicker patients. Those losses were partially offset by lower medical costs than they expected, which is certainly good news. But it\u2019s not great news. Lower-than-expected costs can be from the system working well, or they can simply come from the fact that you happened to get a healthier insurance pool. If the government makes you give the latter gains back, and more, then you\u2019re still not going to be profitable. And insurers that aren\u2019t profitable over the long term aren\u2019t going to stick around.\nNor can you fix the problem by adjusting the transfer fund. Those losses are occurring somewhere in the market; someone has to pay for the care. If you got rid of Obamacare\u2019s risk transfer provisions, those insurers would lose more money, and exit the market, and the patients would end up with some other insurer. Who would then lose a bunch of money on them. Unless the insurance market is profitable in aggregate, the exchanges are not going to stabilize.\n\nMolina\u2019s losses suggest that instead of stabilizing, the exchanges are getting worse. There is no way to fix Obamacare without fixing the pool so that younger, healthier people buy insurance.\n\nDemocrats had six years to come up with a way to do that (or perhaps I should say, a way to do that that could actually get through Congress without hordes of angry voters burning their representatives in effigy). They failed. Now Republicans are taking their shot, and so far at least, they don\u2019t seem any more on target than Democrats were.\n\nThe life expectancy of the individual market for health insurance is not looking good.","Congressional Republicans, evidently hoping that by repeating an untruth they\u2019ll convince American voters, and perhaps themselves, that it\u2019s a truth, on Wednesday said the Affordable Care Act has \u201cfailed.\u201d\n\nThe undistilled version of this view came from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who emerged Wednesday from a meeting with Vice President-elect Mike Pence to assert: \u201cThis law has failed. Americans are struggling. The law is failing while we speak. \u2026 Things are only getting worse under Obamacare. \u2026 The healthcare system has been ruined \u2014 dismantled \u2014 under Obamacare.\u201d\n\nEvery one of those statements is demonstrably untrue. How do we know this? We know because every measure of healthcare spending, access and cost has improved since the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Timothy McBride of Washington University in St. Louis has done the heavy lifting of pulling together the relevant charts and graphs, and posting them online in a series of 12 tweets compiled on Storify. We\u2019ve culled some of the most important, and present them here.\n\nWe should add, first, that Ryan also pledged, once the GOP repeals the law, to \u201cmake sure that there is a stable transition to a truly patient-centered system. We want every American to have access to quality, affordable health coverage\u201d\n\nThis is nothing but fatuous gobbledygook. The GOP has had six years to come up with an alternative plan, and never has done so. Its current strategy is to repeal the Affordable Care Act now, and then cook up a replacement sometime in the next two, three, even four years. (They can\u2019t even agree on a time frame.) What exactly is a \u201cpatient-centered system,\u201d anyway?\n\nHere are the charts, courtesy of professor McBride.\n\nFirst, the overall uninsured rate has come sharply down since the advent of Obamacare:\nThe uninsured rate for non-elderly adults fell from nearly 16% in 2010 to less than 10%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's now at a historic low.\nThe decline in uninsured rates was especially pronounced among lower-income Americans, according to the Council of Economic Advisors and other sources:\n\nUninsured rates fell by more than 10 percentage points among the poorest Americans eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 those earning less than 138% of the federal poverty line.\nAlthough Republicans claim that even if the Affordable Care Act brought down the uninsured rate, its enrollees had trouble seeing a doctor, that isn\u2019t true. Numerous studies debunk claims that doctors shun Affordable Care Act enrollees. This sample by the Council of Economic Advisors shows that the decline in the uninsured rate is closely associated with a reduction in people who were prevented from seeking and finding medical care because of its cost:\n\nHospitals are major beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act, as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Council of Economic Advisors report. Hospitals\u2019 uncompensated care costs fell sharply in Medicaid expansion states, as patients treated as indigent in the past are now covered by Medicaid. Their uncompensated care costs fell from an average 4% of operating costs before the Affordable Care Act to less than 2% afterward, a decline worth tens of billions of dollars nationwide.\n\nOverall national health spending has come down even faster than was predicted, as a share of gross domestic product:\n\n\nThe average growth in per-enrollee spending by private health plans in key categories has slowed materially since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, from annual growth averaging 5% in 2000-2010, to 1.5% in 2010-2015. Spending growth on hospital services, physician services and prescription drugs all slowed. Medicare, which has instituted numerous cost-control initiatives under the Affordable Care Act, has seen an overall decline in spending per enrollee.\n\nFinally, even though employer-based insurance hasn\u2019t yet been directly affected by the Affordable Care Act, there seems to be a spillover effect from the overall reduction in healthcare spending growth. Premiums rose by an average 5.6% a year in the 10 years prior to passage of the Affordable Care Act, but only 3.1% since, according to Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s annual survey of employer health benefits.\n\n\nRepublicans have promised to give Americans a health insurance system better than the Affordable Care Act\u2019s and at lower cost. This is almost surely a chimera; no plan that the GOP has considered would expand coverage beyond the Affordable Care Act. To the extent that the plans would reduce costs, they would do so by relieving the federal government of responsibility for paying for coverage and placing it even more heavily on the shoulders of individuals and families. That\u2019s not lowering costs; it\u2019s just shifting them to those least able to pay. The fact that the GOP will have to face is that bringing healthcare to more Americans costs money. Taking it away from millions of Americans will cost money, too.\n\nNo one claimed, either before the passage of the Affordable Care Act or afterward, that it was perfect or that it would solve America\u2019s healthcare crisis in one swipe. What became evident in the three years since the individual insurance exchanges opened for business (on Jan. 1, 2014) is that the subsidies for premiums needed to be increased and improved. Because they\u2019re inadequate, especially as households cross the threshold of 400% of the federal poverty line at which subsidies are eliminated \u2014 at about $97,200 for a family of four \u2014 middle-class families in the individual insurance market feel overburdened. They blame Obamacare for this injustice. The real culprits are Republicans who have refused to consider any approach to the Affordable Care Act except repeal. Now the GOP is \u201cit\u201d on healthcare, and it\u2019s discovering that crafting a solution from scratch may be almost impossible.\n\nWhat became evident during the most recent open-enrollment period for Obamacare exchanges is that \u201cObamacare is more popular than ever,\u201d as Kevin Drum of Mother Jones observes. Enrollment grew to 12 million, up by about 1 million from 2015, even in the face of higher premiums. In any case, more than 85% of all enrollees are entitled to subsidies, which limits and in some cases cancels out the higher prices.\n\nYet the GOP pledges to overturn all that. The question the party never has found an answer to is: If this is what a failure looks like, how would it define a success?","Did Obamacare work?\n\nIt\u2019s worth reflecting upon after President Trump and House Republicans failed on Friday to repeal and replace the \u201cdisaster\u201d of Obamacare.\n\nEver since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, it has been so contentious that it can be difficult to see beyond the partisan debate. But by looking at the many ways the law has changed health care, it\u2019s possible to hazard some judgments.\n\nThe answer may vary with your own experience, but it ultimately depends on what you value. For those who believe the primary goal of the law should have been to bring health insurance to more Americans, the rational answer should be: Yes, Obamacare succeeded. More than 20 million Americans gained health coverage through the law.\n\nContinue reading the main story\nFor those who believe the primary goal of the law should have been to make health insurance affordable to all who want it, the rational answer is: No, Obamacare did not achieve uniform affordability. Health care in the United States remains the most expensive in the world, and coverage remains out of the financial reach of many Americans.\n\nFor those who believe the primary goal of the law was to make Americans healthier, the answer has to be: It is too soon to tell.\n\nOne thing is clear, though \u2014 the Affordable Care Act has shifted the nation\u2019s baseline expectations for how health care should work. Its successes have pushed Republican politicians, like Mr. Trump, into making expansive promises to provide insurance to all Americans. Its failures have become focal points, too, leading to calls for lower insurance deductibles and for more choices in doctors and hospitals.\n\nSince Republicans took power, public opinion has suddenly tipped in its favor. For lots of people, \u201cObamacare\u201d has become synonymous with the health care system itself, with its many miracles and dysfunctions.\n\nThere are layers beneath each judgment, of course. The law was broad and complex, with many goals and provisions. This assessment touches on its largest achievements and its biggest disappointments. For many important questions, there is not yet strong evidence either way.\n\nSuccesses:\n\nTwenty million more people have health insurance.\n\nProviding health coverage to the uninsured was Obamacare\u2019s principal goal, and on that measure, it has succeeded. The gain of 20 million insured, based on an Obama administration estimate last year, is probably now even higher.\n\nNot everyone shares the goal of expanded health coverage, and some of those newly insured bristle under an \u201cindividual mandate\u201d to have insurance or pay a fine. Still, many of the newly insured could not have afforded insurance before the law passed or would have been shut out because of pre-existing health conditions.\n\nThe rapid reduction in the number of uninsured Americans has shifted the political debate about health reform. In 2009, many Republicans were comfortable with a status quo in which many Americans couldn\u2019t get health care. Now, Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have said their plans could cover as many people as the Affordable Care Act, although a recent C.B.O. analysis disagreed.\n\nIt has made many Americans more financially secure.\n\nHealth insurance is supposed to provide access to health care, but it is also a financial product, intended to protect people from catastrophic bills if they are sick or injured. It is still early to measure the health law\u2019s full impact, but several studies have found that low-income Americans have become less vulnerable to health-related financial shocks. Studies have found that fewer people struggled with medical bills or avoided medical care because of cost, and that medical debt and bills in collections have declined.\nIt has reduced inequality.\n\nIn an era of growing income and wealth inequality, Obamacare was a starkly redistributive law. Not only did it subsidize health insurance for those with low and middle incomes, but it also raised taxes on high earners. This mix of policies made the law controversial, but it also furthered the Obama administration\u2019s goals of narrowing the gap between rich and poor Americans.\n\nIt made health insurance more comprehensive.\n\nBefore Obamacare, many products could be called \u201chealth insurance.\u201d Now, health plans are required to cover services like maternity care and treatment for drug addiction, and they can\u2019t cap how much they will pay in a given year. Many of the law\u2019s critics dislike its numerous coverage mandates, but the new rules have increased patients\u2019 access to services like mental health counseling, contraception and cancer screenings.\n\nIt lowered the federal deficit.\n\nObamacare was devised with a mix of new spending and taxes, along with cuts to the federal Medicare program, so that it would save more than it cost. A recent forecast from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, if left in place, the Affordable Care Act will continue to save federal dollars through at least 2025. (Recent legislation has made some small changes to the law\u2019s tax provisions, but analysts at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers again and found very little difference.)\n\nFailures:\n\nHealth insurance remains very expensive.\n\nObamacare\u2019s marketplaces and Medicaid expansion make health coverage a good deal for those near the poverty line, but those earning not much more still often struggle to pay health plan premiums, and face deductibles that are much higher than those seen in a typical employer health plan. In the law\u2019s first three years, premiums were lower than expected and grew slowly. But prices shot up this year, causing financial shocks for buyers who don\u2019t receive government help in paying their premiums. Several analysts believe the increases resulted from recent policy changes and too-low early pricing and may represent a one-time market correction. Insurers have also said that they have found the pool of Obamacare enrollees to be sicker and less predictable in their health care needs than expected. Some people who earn enough to qualify for meager or no subsidies find health care unaffordable.\n\nThe health care system remains complex and confusing.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has described the health law\u2019s markets as being like a Kayak or an Amazon for health insurance. They\u2019re not. Health insurance is easier to shop for now, but it remains a complicated and opaque product, and selecting the right health plan is often frustrating or impossible for Americans unsure of their health needs \u2014 or unable to decode jargon like \u201cout-of-pocket maximum\u201d or \u201cin-network provider.\u201d After picking their insurance, patients can still struggle to use it, and can get stuck with surprise bills or long negotiations with their insurance companies.\n\nPhoto\n\nEver since its passage, Obamacare has drawn both praise and protest, like this one by anti-abortion demonstrators outside the Supreme Court in June 2012. Credit Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times\nIn many parts of the country, only one insurer even offers health plans, limiting the choices available to consumers.\n\nIf you like your plan, you can\u2019t always keep your plan. ...\n\nThe Obamacare marketplaces are set up to encourage customers to frequently switch their health plans to avoid steep price increases. The markets have also been turbulent, with insurers going out of business, exiting markets or shifting around their offerings each year. That has led to a large fraction of renewing customers who change health plans every year, unable to pick a plan they like and stick with it.\n\n\u2026 Or your doctor.\n\nMany Obamacare health plans, trying to keep prices competitive, have sharply limited the number of doctors or hospitals they will cover. Obamacare\u2019s authors did not expect so-called narrow network plans to become so widespread. These have made it hard for some customers to find any plan that includes their favored providers, and means that switching plans often means switching doctors, too. The narrower networks, despite their inconveniences, have helped keep insurance prices lower.\n\nToo Soon to Tell:\n\nWe don\u2019t know if the law made America healthier.\n\nHealth insurance is not the same thing as health, and we still have very limited data about whether the law\u2019s coverage expansion has lengthened lives or improved their quality in meaningful ways. There is some encouraging but very early evidence that low-income people in two states that expanded Medicaid reported improving overall health compared with their low-income neighbors in a state that did not. And there is research that more low-income Americans have visited a doctor and have received some basic preventive health services, including prescription contraceptives and treatments for diabetes.\n\nBut it will probably take many more years before it is clear whether the law has been beneficial to public health, or how large that effect may be. Even though the law allowed 20 million more people to get coverage, that\u2019s a small fraction of the nation\u2019s population, and it often takes years for health care services to result in measurable benefits.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the law has done to national health spending.\n\nA crucial goal for Mr. Obama was \u201cbending the cost curve\u201d and slowing the accelerating cost of health care in the United States. Growth in health spending has indeed slowed in the years since Obamacare\u2019s passage, but it is hard to untangle the effects of the health law from other forces affecting health spending, including the Great Recession, rising insurance deductibles and a slowdown in the development of new medical technologies. The health law\u2019s most ardent champions, including Mr. Obama, credit it for this change. But many economists are uncertain whether the slowdown is a result of the law or a mere coincidence.\n\nIt may have improved the quality of care in hospitals.\n\nThe health law contained many provisions intended to make medical care safer and more evidence-based. The health system is still often a dangerous place for patients, but fewer are contracting infections in the hospital, for example, or leaving the hospital only to be readmitted in a few weeks. Some trends were underway before the health law passed, so it is difficult to tease out how much change was caused by Obamacare or would have happened anyway.","Millions may lose coverage next year if Congress does not repeal Obamacare. That\u2019s not what this week\u2019s Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis says, but it is reality. CBO\u2019s estimating models seem impervious to reality. In the real world, the Obamacare exchanges are in crisis, millions of uninsured people willingly pay or avoid IRS penalties, and consumers struggle with rising premiums and cost-sharing requirements. But for CBO, Obamacare is a sea of tranquility. The agency assumes that only 26 million people under the age of 65 will be uninsured this year and next if Obamacare is left in place. To hit that mark, 2 million fewer people would have to be uninsured this year than last. That seems unlikely. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) estimates that 27.9 million people under age 65 lacked coverage as of September 30 last year, the most recent date for which government survey data are available. That represents little improvement over its estimate of 28.4 million as of December 2015, meaning that the number of non-elderly uninsured declined by only half a million through the first nine months of last year. Since then, the Obamacare individual exchanges have begun to implode. Fewer people signed up during the open-enrollment period this year than last, due in part to premium hikes that averaged 25 percent. Other insurance companies didn\u2019t bother raising prices; they fled the exchanges. By January, 1,000 counties were down to their last insurer. Five entire states have just a single company selling through the exchanges. A rational observer might worry that the exchanges were on the brink of doom. Not CBO. Its analysts believe that Obamacare is on the cusp of a miracle. The number of nonelderly uninsured not only will drop this year but hold steady in 2018, according to CBO, even though millions could find themselves without an insurer in their exchanges. That improbably happy outcome would change, the agency says, if Congress were to enact its repeal bill. In that case, CBO warns, the number of uninsured will abruptly increase by 4 million. That includes 2 million Medicaid beneficiaries. CBO believes they will drop out of a program for which they pay virtually nothing and that fully pays virtually all their medical expenses. Ditto for 1 million people in the exchanges and an additional million with job-based coverage. CBO believes that these 4 million people so detest being insured that they will drop out of the system immediately after Congress repeals the tax on the uninsured. That number will rise to 14 million next year, according to CBO. That includes 5 million who will abandon Medicaid, 2 million who will drop their employer-sponsored coverage, and 6 million who will leave the exchanges. These 14 million people will not, despite what you\u2019ve read, \u201close coverage.\u201d For the most part, CBO says, they \u201cwill choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying penalties\u201d [emphasis added]. The GOP bill not only retains existing subsidies and Medicaid expansion through 2019, it provides additional money to states to stabilize their failing Obamacare exchanges. But that spending, according to CBO, won\u2019t halt the stampede to the Obamacare exits induced by repeal of the individual mandate. CBO\u2019s illusions about the effectiveness of the mandate don\u2019t square with reality. The evidence suggests that the mandate has done little to reduce the number of uninsured. The IRS reports that in 2015, 6.5 million paid the penalty, 12.7 million obtained an exemption, while 4.3 million simply ignored it. That\u2019s 23.5 million people who have chosen to be uninsured despite the government\u2019s threat of tax penalties. CBO\u2019s estimates of the effects of the GOP bill are deeply flawed. Let\u2019s do the math. NHIS estimates that 44.3 million non-elderly were uninsured in 2013, the year before Obamacare was fully implemented. If CBO is to be believed, the number of uninsured will increase by 14 million next year, joining another 23.5 million uninsured people who either paid the tax in the past or found a way to avoid it. That would mean that 85 percent of the uninsured (37.5 million out of 44.3 million) apparently would want nothing to do with Obamacare\u2019s government-defined and subsidized benefits were Congress to repeal the individual mandate. If CBO is correct, the government will have spent $462 billion between 2014 and 2018 on subsidies and Medicaid expansions, only to end up reducing the number of nonelderly uninsured from 44.3 million to 41 million. It is also possible that CBO is wrong about the individual mandate. That seems intuitively obvious to people whose heads aren\u2019t buried in CBO\u2019s faulty models. Some future progressive government may well decide to attack the problem of homelessness by supplementing the mortgage-interest deduction with a tax on the homeless. But does anyone believe that if a Republican Congress repealed that tax, homeowners would shred their mortgages and head to the grates? CBO\u2019s estimates of the effects of the GOP bill are deeply flawed. They begin with rosy assumptions about the current law. In the face of considerable contrary evidence, they assume that insurers will continue to sell in the exchanges next year and that there will be no appreciable disruption in coverage. They appear to believe that higher coverage rates that have occurred since 2014 are more attributable to tax penalties than to subsidies, despite feckless IRS enforcement. And they assume that even if Congress keeps the tax credits and Medicaid expansion in place next year and spends additional money to stabilize insurance markets, 14 million more people will join the ranks of the uninsured. Congress should set policy based on reality, not on CBO\u2019s speculations. Obamacare exchanges are falling apart, Medicaid spending is growing at an excessive pace, and taxing the uninsured is both ineffective and politically unsustainable. The House and Senate should act now to stabilize those markets, repeal the law (including the individual mandate), and replace it with a system that puts doctors and patients in control of health-care decision-making.\n","Come November, the grim trudge across the increasingly barren Obamacare landscape begins anew. Illinois consumers likely face staggering price hikes for individual insurance policies. Some types of plans could cost an average of 43 percent to 55 percent more. Ditto across the country: A first tranche of states approved 2017 rates with similarly cardiac-arrest-inducing premium increases.\n\nMany Illinois consumers will find fewer choices because major carriers fled this market. UnitedHealthcare bolted. So did Aetna. Land of Lincoln Health collapsed mid-year, leaving policy holders to scramble for coverage that could cost them plenty. In many places across Illinois and the nation, people will find drastically fewer choices of plans than they did last year.\n\nStates struggling with Obamacare are undermining the law\nThe Affordable Care Act has been criticized since it was passed in 2010. Its success depended on states supporting their marketplaces and enrolling healthy consumers. Sept. 7, 2016.\nThose insurers fled because they didn't want to lose more money on a government-run market that is so far out of whack \u2014 a market they think likely will never be profitable for them. That isn't surprising, as we enumerate below.\n\nBut by diagnosing Obamacare, all of us can see the mistakes that any repair or replacement can avoid. So let's look at the failings and how they can drive solutions:\n\nObamacare failed because it flunked Economics 101 and Human Nature 101. It straitjacketed insurers into providing overly expensive, soup-to-nuts policies. It wasn't flexible enough so that people could buy as much coverage as they wanted and could afford \u2014 not what the government dictated. Many healthy people primarily want catastrophic coverage. Obamacare couldn't lure them in, couldn't persuade them to buy on the chance they'd get sick.\n\nObamacare failed because the penalties for going uncovered are too low when stacked against its skyrocketing premium costs. Next year, the penalty for staying uninsured is $695 per adult, or perhaps 2.5 percent of a family's taxable household income. That's far less than many Americans would pay for coverage.\n\nObamacare failed because insurance is based on risk pools \u2014 that is, the lucky subsidize the unlucky. The unlucky who have big health problems (and big medical bills) reap much greater benefits than those who remain healthy and out of the doctors' office. But Obamacare's rules hamstring insurers. They can't exclude people for pre-existing conditions, and can't charge older customers more than three times as much as the young. Those are good goals, but they skew the market in ways Obamacare didn't figure out how to offset. Result: Young and healthy consumers pay far more in premiums than their claims (probably) would justify in order to subsidize the unexpectedly large influx of older, sicker customers who require expensive care. Too many unlucky people, too few lucky people: That will collapse any insurance scheme.\n\nObamacare failed because it allowed Americans to sign up after they got sick and needed help paying all those medical bills. Insurance should be structured so that, although you don't know if you'll need it, you pay for it anyway, just in case; your alternative is financial doom. But if you can game the system and, for example, buy auto coverage after you crash into your garage, then you have no incentive to buy insurance beforehand.\n\nObamacare failed because it hasn't tamed U.S. medical costs. Health care is about supply and demand: People who get coverage use it, especially if the law mandates free preventive care. Iron law of economics: Nothing is free; someone pays. To pretend otherwise was folly. Those forces combined to spike the costs of care, and thus insurance costs.\n\nObamacare failed because too many carriers simply can't cover expenses, let alone turn a profit, in this rigidly controlled system. Take Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, the state's dominant Obamacare insurer. Last year, for every dollar the carrier collected, it spent $1.32 buying care and providing services for customers, according to BCBS President Maurice Smith. No wonder BCBS is proposing rate increases from 23 percent to 45 percent for its individual plans.\n\nA question looms: Is Obamacare plunging in a so-called insurance death spiral? Is the market so unstable that plans are doomed to get more and more expensive, driving more Americans and more insurers out of the market until ... Obamacare thuds to the pavement?\n\nMore Americans have health insurance, for now\nWe won't predict that, but neither do we see a mathematical alternative. What's clear is that the solutions to Obamacare are implicit in its failures. A repaired or replaced system has to be more flexible, letting insurers offer a wider range of plans so that consumers, not lawmakers or bureaucrats, dictate what's best for them. That system should protect those who carry continuous coverage, not coddle those who duck in and out of plans when their health needs change.\n\nA new system also should scrap the job-killing Obamacare mandates that discourage companies from hiring and discourage workers from adding hours. Instead of gearing subsidies to incomes, let Americans not covered via an employer reap tax credits to help finance their insurance purchases on the open market. And tell us again: Why can't insurers sell policies across state lines? Imagine the pricing competition that would unleash.\n\nWe can deny the current system's failings, or we can parlay our evolving knowledge into something much better.\n\nPut another way: The next president and Congress either reckon with Obamacare's failures or ... wait for the thud.","Remember how much Republicans wanted to repeal Obamacare?\n\nThe Republican majority in the House of Representatives has voted more than 50 times to repeal the law. Conservatives have twice brought challenges to the Supreme Court \u2014 a court with powerful voices that often lean in their direction \u2014 only to be largely rebuffed both times. The last government shutdown was driven by Republicans who insisted on defunding Obamacare (not to be confused with what may be the next government shutdown, driven by Republicans insisting on defunding Planned Parenthood).\n\nSome suggest that the calls for repealing Obamacare are fading. Sarah Kliff argued that the \u201cnear-complete absence of Obama\u2019s health overhaul\u201d in last week\u2019s Republican presidential debate was \u201cremarkable.\u201d\n\nMaybe, but don\u2019t count on it. In GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush\u2019s white paper on how he would get to 4 percent growth through supply-side tax cuts, his team of economists stresses that repealing the Affordable Care Act will be an \u201cimportant means of enhancing economic growth.\u201d Front-runner Donald Trump said just last week that he was going to replace Obamacare with \u201cDonaldCare,\u201d which would be both \u201cabsolutely great\u201d and \u201creally spectacular.\u201d Repealing health-care reform remains a prominent talking point for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Ted Cruz, both GOP presidential candidates.\n\nWell, since we don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it, I can\u2019t comment on DonaldCare.\n\nBut I can tell you this about Obamacare: When it comes to meeting one of its most important goals \u2014 providing coverage to the uninsured \u2014 it is working extremely well. It\u2019s posting historical gains on this front and, in so doing, both insulating itself from repeal and creating a daunting political challenge for its opponents.\n\nThe facts of the case are thoroughly drawn out in this new analysis by my colleagues Matt Broaddus and Edwin Park (B&amp;P) from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities:\n\n\u2014 As the figure above shows, newly released census data show that the share of those without health coverage fell from 13.3 percent to 10.4 last year.\n\n\u2014 That\u2019s the largest single-year drop on record based on data going back to 1987.\n\nhi2\nSource: B&amp;P (see text)\n\u2014 In this type of work, the strength of your findings are much bolstered when you see them across multiple sources. As B&amp;P point out, the census findings are \u201cconsistent with the historic coverage gains measured in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention\u2019s National Health Interview Survey and several private surveys\u2026at 9.2 percent, the CDC\u2019s estimated uninsured rate for the first quarter of 2015 was the lowest since the CDC began collecting these data in 1997 and more than 40 percent below the peak in 2010.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The ACA takes a two-pronged attack on covering the uninsured, subsidizing private coverage through the exchanges and expanding Medicaid in the 25 states (as well as D.C.) that accepted that part of the deal. Both private and public coverage are making significant gains.\n\n\u2014 Speaking of anti-Obamacare ideology and its effect on people, B&amp;P provide this revealing calculation: \u201cIf the uninsured rate had fallen in non-expansion states at the same rate as in expansion states, an additional 2.6 million uninsured Americans would have gained coverage last year.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Coverage last year grew most quickly among households with income below $50,000; their uninsured rate fell from about 20 percent to about 15 percent \u2014 in one year! Households above $50,000 had lower uninsured rates to start with, so we would expect smaller changes, but they, too, went from 9 percent to 7.4 percent.\n\nSuch truths are more than inconvenient for sworn enemies of the law. They can bob and weave in their primaries, but once they reach the general election, their Democratic opponent will slam them on these points. And unless they\u2019re willing to massively flip \u2014 pretty unimaginable, given the heat generated by the issue for conservatives \u2014 people represented in the numbers and charts above will rightfully fear that their health security is at stake.\n\nI cannot overemphasize the importance of these facts, and, yes, I know better than most that our political discourse too often exists in a fact-free zone. But the success of the ACA strikes at the heart of the dysfunction strategy employed extremely effectively by anti-government conservatives. This is the self-fulfilling-prophecy strategy that campaigns on: \u201cWashington is broken! Send me there and I\u2019ll make sure it stays that way!\u201d\n\nRemember, when government messes up, when it shuts down, when it fails to address the things that matter to most people \u2014 economic opportunity, wage stagnation, affordable college \u2014 and, instead, squabbles about Planned Parenthood, the winners are those who can say: \u201cSee? We told you.
